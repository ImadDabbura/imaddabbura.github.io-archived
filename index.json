Building the database helps us do complex analytics regarding users activity as well as song play analysis.\nData The songs\u0026rsquo; metadata sourse is a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Also, the users\u0026rsquo; activities is a simulated data using eventsim. The data resides in two main directories:\n Songs metadata: collection of JSON files that describes the songs such as title, artist name, year, etc. Logs data: collection of JSON files where each file covers the users activities over a given day.  Methodology We\u0026rsquo;ll build the database by optimizing the tables around efficient reads for complex queries. To do that, Star schema will be used utilizing dimensional modeling as follows:\n Fact table: songplays. Dimensions tables: songs, artist, users, time.  The three most important advantages of using Star schema are:\n Denormalized tables. Simplified queries. Fast aggregation.  HOW TO The source code is available in three separate Python scripts. Below is a brief description of the main files:\n sql_queries.py has all the queries needed to both create/drop tables for the database as well as a SQL query to get song_id and artist_id from other tables since they are not provided in logs dataset. create_tables.py creates the database, establish the connection and creates/drops all the tables required using sql_queries module. etl.py build the pipeline that extracts the data from JSON files, does some transformation (such as adding different time attributes from timestamp) and then insert all the data into the corresponding tables.  Therefore, we first run create_tables.py then etl.py to create the database, create tables, and then insert the data using the ETL pipeline.\nExamples %load_ext sql %sql postgresql://student:student@127.0.0.1/sparkifydb %%sql SELECT COUNT(*) from songplays;     postgresql://student:***@127.0.0.1/sparkifydb\n1 rows affected.\nOut[1]: count 6820\n   Check out the project on github.\n","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554681600,"objectID":"0a3f7abdaea8b3b267eb9d2ec038ce85","permalink":"https://imaddabbura.github.io/project/data-modeling-with-postgres/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/data-modeling-with-postgres/","section":"project","summary":"Build a Relational Database using Star Schema of song's users activities data.","tags":["Data Science"],"title":"Data Modeling with Postgres","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"  -- Introduction Conda in an open source package management system that works on all platforms. It is a tool that helps manage packages and environments for different programming languages. Develop a high level understanding of how Conda works helped me at so many levels especially when it comes to managing environments and make my work more reproducable. Below are the notes that I wrote down during my journey of learning Conda and I always refere back to them:\nGeneral  Conda packages are files and executables that can in principle contain images, data, noteboeeks, files, etc. Conda mainly used in Python ecosystem; however, it can be used with other languages such R, Julia, Scala, etc. When installing a package using Conda, it installs its dependencies with it. Also, Conda is able to figure out the platform you're using without the need to specify the platform when installing packages. When installing a package, Conda:  Checks the platform. Checks the Python version. Install the latest version of the package that is compatible with Python. If it has dependencies, installs the latest versions of the dependencies that are also compatible with each other.  Under semantic versioning, software is labeled with a three-part version identifier of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; the label components are non-negative integers separated by periods. Assuming all software starts at version 0.0.0, the MAJOR version number is increased when significant new functionality is introduced (often with corresponding API changes). Increases in the MINOR version number generally reflect improvements (e.g., new features) that avoid backward-incompatible API changes. For instance, adding an optional argument to a function API (in a way that allows old code to run unchanged) is a change worthy of increasing the MINOR version number. An increment to the PATCH version number is approriate mostly for bug fixes that preserve the same MAJOR and MINOR revision numbers. Software patches do not typically introduce new features or change APIs at all (except sometimes to address security issues). We can specify MAJOR, MAJOR.MINOR, or MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH when installing any package. We can use logical operators to install versions of a package. Examples:  conda install 'python=3.6|3.7'. conda install 'python=3.6|3.7*' . conda install 'python\u0026gt;=3.6, \u0026lt;=3.7'.   Common Commands  To update a package, conda update pckg. To uninstall a package, conda remove pckg. To search what available versions of a specific package is available, use conda search pckg. conda list will list all installed packages. conda list -n env-name will list all packages in the environment env-name. conda list pckg will give information about pckg. When installing a pckg without including a channel, it defaults to the main channel that is maintained by Anaconda Inc. There other channels where people can upload their packages to and we can reach to those channels when looking for installation such fastai. We use conda install -c fastai fastai. Here the channel is fastai and the pckg is also fastai. conda search -c conda-forge -c fastai --override-channels --platform osx-64 fastai means:  Search for fastai in two channels: conda-forge, fastai. override-channels means do not go to default main channel. platform specify which platform.  Sometimes we don't know the channel of the pckg, we can use anaconda search pckg that will return all the channels that the pckg is at and their versions. conda-forge is almost as good as the main channels which is led by the community. It has a lot more packages than the main channel. There is no system that rates channels, so be carefel when installing packages from any channel. We can list all packages in a channel such as conda search -c conda-forge --override-channels that will list all packages for the conda-forge channel.  Environments  Environments are a good practice of documenting data science/software development work. Environments are nothing more than a directory that contains all the packages so that when trying to import them, it imports them from this directory only. we can use conda env list to see all the available environments on our machine. To get the packages from a specific environment by name, use conda list -n env-name. Otherwise, we get the packages from the current environment. To activate an environment, use conda activate env-name. To deactivate, conda deactivate. Environments usually don't take a lot of space. We can remove environments using conda env remove -n env-name. To create an environment, use conda create -n env-name. We can also add additional package names to install after creation such as conda create -n env-name python=3.6* numpy\u0026gt;=1.1. To export an environment, use conda env export -n env-name. This will return the output to the terminal. We can also export to a file. For that use conda env export -n env-name -f env-name.yml. The '.yml' extension is strongly enouraged. Doing this will assure that all the packages used can be installed by others exactly. We can create also an environment from .yml file using conda env create -f env-name.yml. Note also that if we only use conda env create, it will look for a file that has .yml extension and has the same name as env-name in the current local directory. Moreover, we can create the .yml file with doing the export ourselves and only specify what is important in our environments.

It can be defined as the task of identifying subgroups in the data such that data points in the same subgroup (cluster) are very similar while data points in different clusters are very different. In other words, we try to find homogeneous subgroups within the data such that data points in each cluster are as similar as possible according to a similarity measure such as euclidean-based distance or correlation-based distance. The decision of which similarity measure to use is application-specific.\nClustering analysis can be done on the basis of features where we try to find subgroups of samples based on features or on the basis of samples where we try to find subgroups of features based on samples. We'll cover here clustering based on features. Clustering is used in market segmentation; where we try to fin d customers that are similar to each other whether in terms of behaviors or attributes, image segmentation/compression; where we try to group similar regions together, document clustering based on topics, etc.\nUnlike supervised learning, clustering is considered an unsupervised learning method since we don't have the ground truth to compare the output of the clustering algorithm to the true labels to evaluate its performance. We only want to try to investigate the structure of the data by grouping the data points into distinct subgroups.\nIn this post, we will cover only Kmeans which is considered as one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms due to its simplicity.\n Kmeans Algorithm \nKmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to make the inter-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible. It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the cluster's centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. The less variation we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points are within the same cluster.\nThe way kmeans algorithm works is as follows:\n Specify number of clusters K. Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement. Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isn't changing.  Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids. Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid). Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of all data points that belong to each cluster.   The approach kmeans follows to solve the problem is called Expectation-Maximization. The E-step is assigning the data points to the closest cluster. The M-step is computing the centroid of each cluster. Below is a break down of how we can solve it mathematically (feel free to skip it).\nThe objective function is:\n\\[J = \\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\\sum_{k = 1}^{K}w_{ik}\\|x^i - \\mu_k\\|^2\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere $w_{ik} = 1$ for data point $x^i$ if it belongs to cluster k; otherwise, $w_{ik} = 0$. Also, $\\mu_k$ is the centroid of $x^i$'s cluster.\nIt's a minimization problem of two parts. We first minimize J w.r.t. $w_{ik}$ and treat $\\mu_k$ fixed. Then we minimize J w.r.t. $\\muk$ and treat $w{ik}$ fixed. Technically speaking, we differentiate J w.r.t. $w_{ik}$ first and update cluster assignments (E-step). Then we differentiate J w.r.t. $\\mu_{k}$ and recompute the centroids after the cluster assignments from previous step (M-step). Therefore, E-step is:\n\\(\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w_{ik}} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\\|x^i - \\mu_k\\|^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow \\begin{equation} w_{ik} = \\begin{cases} 1 \u0026 \\text{if $k = arg min_j\\ \\|x^i - \\mu_j\\|^2$} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \u0026 \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\tag{2}\\) In other words, assign the data point $x^i$ to the closest cluster judged by its sum of squared distance from cluster's centroid.\nAnd M-step is:\n\\(\\ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\mu_k} = 2\\sum_{i = 1}^{m}w_{ik}(x^i - \\mu_k) = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow \\mu_k = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{m}w_{ik}x^i}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{m}w_{ik}}\\tag{3}\\) Which translates to recomputing the centroid of each cluster to reflect the new assignments.\nFew things to note here:\n Since clustering algorithms including kmeans use distance-based measurements to determine the similarity between data points, it's recommended to standardize the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one since almost always the features in any dataset would have different units of measurements such as age vs income. Given kmeans iterative nature and the random initialization of centroids at the start of the algorithm, different initializations may lead to different clusters since kmeans algorithm may stuck in a local optimum and may not converge to global optimum. Therefore, it's recommended to run the algorithm using different initializations of centroids and pick the results of the run that that yielded the lower sum of squared distance. Assignment of examples isn't changing is the same thing as no change in within-cluster variation:  \\[\\frac{1}{m_k}\\sum_{i = 1}^{m_k}\\|x^i - \\mu_{c^k}\\|^2\\tag{4}\\]\n Implementation \nWe'll use simple implementation of kmeans here to just illustrate some concepts. Then we will use sklearn implementation that is more efficient take care of many things for us.\nimport numpy as np from numpy.linalg import norm class Kmeans: '''Implementing Kmeans algorithm.''' def __init__(self, n_clusters, max_iter=100, random_state=123): self.n_clusters = n_clusters self.max_iter = max_iter self.random_state = random_state def initializ_centroids(self, X): np.random.RandomState(self.random_state) random_idx = np.random.permutation(X.shape[0]) centroids = X[random_idx[:self.n_clusters]] return centroids def compute_centroids(self, X, labels): centroids = np.zeros((self.n_clusters, X.shape[1])) for k in range(self.n_clusters): centroids[k, :] = np.mean(X[labels == k, :], axis=0) return centroids def compute_distance(self, X, centroids): distance = np.zeros((X.shape[0], self.n_clusters)) for k in range(self.n_clusters): row_norm = norm(X - centroids[k, :], axis=1) distance[:, k] = np.square(row_norm) return distance def find_closest_cluster(self, distance): return np.argmin(distance, axis=1) def compute_sse(self, X, labels, centroids): distance = np.zeros(X.shape[0]) for k in range(self.n_clusters): distance[labels == k] = norm(X[labels == k] - centroids[k], axis=1) return np.sum(np.square(distance)) def fit(self, X): self.centroids = self.initializ_centroids(X) for i in range(self.max_iter): old_centroids = self.centroids distance = self.compute_distance(X, old_centroids) self.labels = self.find_closest_cluster(distance) self.centroids = self.compute_centroids(X, self.labels) if np.all(old_centroids == self.centroids): break self.error = self.compute_sse(X, self.labels, self.centroids) def predict(self, X): distance = self.compute_distance(X, old_centroids) return self.find_closest_cluster(distance)   Applications \nkmeans algorithm is very popular and used in a variety of applications such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression, etc. The goal usually when we undergo a cluster analysis is either:\n Get a meaningful intuition of the structure of the data we're dealing with. Cluster-then-predict where different models will be built for different subgroups if we believe there is a wide variation in the behaviors of different subgroups. An example of that is clustering patients into different subgroups and build a model for each subgroup to predict the probability of the risk of having heart attack.  In this post, we'll apply clustering on two cases:\n Geyser eruptions segmentation (2-D dataset). Image compression.   Kmeans on Geyser's Eruptions Segmentation \nWe'll first implement the kmeans algorithm on 2D dataset and see how it works. The dataset has 272 observations and 2 features. The data covers the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. We will try to find K subgroups within the data points and group them accordingly. Below is the description of the features:\n eruptions (float): Eruption time in minutes. waiting (int): Waiting time to next eruption.  Let's plot the data first:\n# Modules import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.image import imread import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import (make_blobs, make_circles, make_moons) from sklearn.cluster import KMeans, SpectralClustering from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_samples, silhouette_score %matplotlib inline sns.set_context('notebook') plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight') from warnings import filterwarnings filterwarnings('ignore')  # Import the data df = pd.read_csv('../data/old_faithful.csv') # Plot the data plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.scatter(df.iloc[:, 0], df.iloc[:, 1]) plt.xlabel('Eruption time in mins') plt.ylabel('Waiting time to next eruption') plt.title('Visualization of raw data');     We'll use this data because it's easy to plot and visually spot the clusters since its a 2-dimension dataset. It's obvious that we have 2 clusters. Let's standardize the data first and run the kmeans algorithm on the standardized data with $K = 2$.\n# Standardize the data X_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df) # Run local implementation of kmeans km = Kmeans(n_clusters=2, max_iter=100) km.fit(X_std) centroids = km.centroids # Plot the clustered data fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.scatter(X_std[km.labels == 0, 0], X_std[km.labels == 0, 1], c='green', label='cluster 1') plt.scatter(X_std[km.labels == 1, 0], X_std[km.labels == 1, 1], c='blue', label='cluster 2') plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], marker='*', s=300, c='r', label='centroid') plt.legend() plt.xlim([-2, 2]) plt.ylim([-2, 2]) plt.xlabel('Eruption time in mins') plt.ylabel('Waiting time to next eruption') plt.title('Visualization of clustered data', fontweight='bold') ax.set_aspect('equal');     The above graph shows the scatter plot of the data colored by the cluster they belong to. In this example, we chose $K = 2$. The symbol '*' is the centroid of each cluster. We can think of those 2 clusters as geyser had different kinds of behaviors under different scenarios.\nNext, we'll show that different initializations of centroids may yield to different results. I'll use 9 different random_state to change the initialization of the centroids and plot the results. The title of each plot will be the sum of squared distance of each initialization.\nAs a side note, this dataset is considered very easy and converges in less than 10 iterations. Therefore, to see the effect of random initialization on convergence, I am going to go with 3 iterations to illustrate the concept. However, in real world applications, datasets are not at all that clean and nice!\nn_iter = 9 fig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(16, 16)) ax = np.ravel(ax) centers = [] for i in range(n_iter): # Run local implementation of kmeans km = Kmeans(n_clusters=2, max_iter=3, random_state=np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=1)) km.fit(X_std) centroids = km.centroids centers.append(centroids) ax[i].scatter(X_std[km.labels == 0, 0], X_std[km.labels == 0, 1], c='green', label='cluster 1') ax[i].scatter(X_std[km.labels == 1, 0], X_std[km.labels == 1, 1], c='blue', label='cluster 2') ax[i].scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='r', marker='*', s=300, label='centroid') ax[i].set_xlim([-2, 2]) ax[i].set_ylim([-2, 2]) ax[i].legend(loc='lower right') ax[i].set_title(f'{km.error:.4f}') ax[i].set_aspect('equal') plt.tight_layout();     As the graph above shows that we only ended up with two different ways of clusterings based on different initializations. We would pick the one with the lowest sum of squared distance.\n Kmeans on Image Compression \nIn this part, we'll implement kmeans to compress an image. The image that we'll be working on is 396 x 396 x 3. Therefore, for each pixel location we would have 3 8-bit integers that specify the red, green, and blue intensity values. Our goal is to reduce the number of colors to 30 and represent (compress) the photo using those 30 colors only. To pick which colors to use, we'll use kmeans algorithm on the image and treat every pixel as a data point. That means reshape the image from height x width x channels to (height * width) x channel, i,e we would have 396 x 396 = 156,816 data points in 3-dimensional space which are the intensity of RGB. Doing so will allow us to represent the image using the 30 centroids for each pixel and would significantly reduce the size of the image by a factor of 6. The original image size was 396 x 396 x 24 = 3,763,584 bits; however, the new compressed image would be 30 x 24 + 396 x 396 x 4 = 627,984 bits. The huge difference comes from the fact that we'll be using centroids as a lookup for pixels' colors and that would reduce the size of each pixel location to 4-bit instead of 8-bit.\nFrom now on we will be using sklearn implementation of kmeans. Few thing to note here:\n n_init is the number of times of running the kmeans with different centroid's initialization. The result of the best one will be reported. tol is the within-cluster variation metric used to declare convergence. The default of init is k-means++ which is supposed to yield a better results than just random initialization of centroids.  # Read the image img = imread('images/my_image.jpg') img_size = img.shape # Reshape it to be 2-dimension X = img.reshape(img_size[0] * img_size[1], img_size[2]) # Run the Kmeans algorithm km = KMeans(n_clusters=30) km.fit(X) # Use the centroids to compress the image X_compressed = km.cluster_centers_[km.labels_] X_compressed = np.clip(X_compressed.astype('uint8'), 0, 255) # Reshape X_recovered to have the same dimension as the original image 128 * 128 * 3 X_compressed = X_compressed.reshape(img_size[0], img_size[1], img_size[2]) # Plot the original and the compressed image next to each other fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 8)) ax[0].imshow(img) ax[0].set_title('Original Image') ax[1].imshow(X_compressed) ax[1].set_title('Compressed Image with 30 colors') for ax in fig.axes: ax.axis('off') plt.tight_layout();     We can see the comparison between the original image and the compressed one. The compressed image looks close to the original one which means we're able to retain the majority of the characteristics of the original image. With smaller number of clusters we would have higher compression rate at the expense of image quality. As a side note, this image compression method is called lossy data compression because we can't reconstruct the original image from the compressed image.\n Evaluation Methods \nContrary to supervised learning where we have the ground truth to evaluate the model's performance, clustering analysis doesn't have a solid evaluation metric that we can use to evaluate the outcome of different clustering algorithms. Moreover, since kmeans requires k as an input and doesn't learn it from data, there is no right answer in terms of the number of clusters that we should have in any problem. Sometimes domain knowledge and intuition may help but usually that is not the case. In the cluster-predict methodology, we can evaluate how well the models are performing based on different K clusters since clusters are used in the downstream modeling.\nIn this post we'll cover two metrics that may give us some intuition about k:\n Elbow method Silhouette analysis   Elbow Method  Elbow method gives us an idea on what a good k number of clusters would be based on the sum of squared distance (SSE) between data points and their assigned clusters' centroids. We pick k at the spot where SSE starts to flatten out and forming an elbow. We'll use the geyser dataset and evaluate SSE for different values of k and see where the curve might form an elbow and flatten out.\n# Run the Kmeans algorithm and get the index of data points clusters sse = [] list_k = list(range(1, 10)) for k in list_k: km = KMeans(n_clusters=k) km.fit(X_std) sse.append(km.inertia_) # Plot sse against k plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.plot(list_k, sse, '-o') plt.xlabel(r'Number of clusters *k*') plt.ylabel('Sum of squared distance');     The graph above shows that $k = 2$ is not a bad choice. Sometimes it's still hard to figure out a good number of clusters to use because the curve is monotonically decreasing and may not show any elbow or has an obvious point where the curve starts flattening out.\n Silhouette Analysis \nSilhouette analysis can be used to determine the degree of separation between clusters. For each sample:\n Compute the average distance from all data points in the same cluster ($a^i$). Compute the average distance from all data points in the closest cluster ($b^i$). Compute the coefficient:  \\[\\frac{b^i - a^i}{max(a^i, b^i)}\\]\nThe coefficient can take values in the interval .\n If it is 0 --\u0026gt; the sample is very close to the neighboring clusters. If it is 1 --\u0026gt; the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters. If it is -1 --\u0026gt; the sample is assigned to the wrong clusters.  Therefore, we want the coefficients to be as big as possible and close to 1 to have a good clusters. We'll use here geyser dataset again because its cheaper to run the silhouette analysis and it is actually obvious that there is most likely only two groups of data points.\nfor i, k in enumerate([2, 3, 4]): fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2) fig.set_size_inches(18, 7) # Run the Kmeans algorithm km = KMeans(n_clusters=k) labels = km.fit_predict(X_std) centroids = km.cluster_centers_ # Get silhouette samples silhouette_vals = silhouette_samples(X_std, labels) # Silhouette plot y_ticks = [] y_lower, y_upper = 0, 0 for i, cluster in enumerate(np.unique(labels)): cluster_silhouette_vals = silhouette_vals[labels == cluster] cluster_silhouette_vals.sort() y_upper += len(cluster_silhouette_vals) ax1.barh(range(y_lower, y_upper), cluster_silhouette_vals, edgecolor='none', height=1) ax1.text(-0.03, (y_lower + y_upper) / 2, str(i + 1)) y_lower += len(cluster_silhouette_vals) # Get the average silhouette score and plot it avg_score = np.mean(silhouette_vals) ax1.axvline(avg_score, linestyle='--', linewidth=2, color='green') ax1.set_yticks([]) ax1.set_xlim([-0.1, 1]) ax1.set_xlabel('Silhouette coefficient values') ax1.set_ylabel('Cluster labels') ax1.set_title('Silhouette plot for the various clusters', y=1.02); # Scatter plot of data colored with labels ax2.scatter(X_std[:, 0], X_std[:, 1], c=labels) ax2.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], marker='*', c='r', s=250) ax2.set_xlim([-2, 2]) ax2.set_xlim([-2, 2]) ax2.set_xlabel('Eruption time in mins') ax2.set_ylabel('Waiting time to next eruption') ax2.set_title('Visualization of clustered data', y=1.02) ax2.set_aspect('equal') plt.tight_layout() plt.suptitle(f'Silhouette analysis using k = {k}', fontsize=16, fontweight='semibold', y=1.05);           As the above plots show, n_clusters=2 has the best average silhouette score of around 0.75 and all clusters being above the average shows that it is actually a good choice. Also, the thickness of the silhouette plot gives an indication of how big each cluster is. The plot shows that cluster 1 has almost double the samples than cluster 2. However, as we increased n_clusters to 3 and 4, the average silhouette score decreased dramatically to around 0.48 and 0.39 respectively. Moreover, the thickness of silhouette plot started showing wide fluctuations. The bottom line is: Good n_clusters will have a well above 0.5 silhouette average score as well as all of the clusters have higher than the average score.\n Drawbacks \nKmeans algorithm is good in capturing structure of the data if clusters have a spherical-like shape. It always try to construct a nice spherical shape around the centroid. That means, the minute the clusters have a complicated geometric shapes, kmeans does a poor job in clustering the data. We'll illustrate three cases where kmeans will not perform well.\nFirst, kmeans algorithm doesn't let data points that are far-away from each other share the same cluster even though they obviously belong to the same cluster. Below is an example of data points on two different horizontal lines that illustrates how kmeans tries to group half of the data points of each horizontal lines together.\n# Create horizantal data X = np.tile(np.linspace(1, 5, 20), 2) y = np.repeat(np.array([2, 4]), 20) df = np.c_[X, y] km = KMeans(n_clusters=2) km.fit(df) labels = km.predict(df) centroids = km.cluster_centers_ fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.scatter(X, y, c=labels) plt.xlim([0, 6]) plt.ylim([0, 6]) plt.text(5.1, 4, 'A', color='red') plt.text(5.1, 2, 'B', color='red') plt.text(2.8, 4.1, 'C', color='red') ax.set_aspect('equal')     Kmeans considers the point 'B' closer to point 'A' than point 'C' since they have non-spherical shape. Therefore, points 'A' and 'B' will be in the same cluster but point 'C' will be in a different cluster. Note the Single Linkage hierarchical clustering method gets this right because it doesn't separate similar points).\nSecond, we'll generate data from multivariate normal distributions with different means and standard deviations. So we would have 3 groups of data where each group was generated from different multivariate normal distribution (different mean/standard deviation). One group will have a lot more data points than the other two combined. Next, we'll run kmeans on the data with $K = 3$ and see if it will be able to cluster the data correctly. To make the comparison easier, I am going to plot first the data colored based on the distribution it came from. Then I will plot the same data but now colored based on the clusters they have been assigned to.\n# Create data from three different multivariate distributions X_1 = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean=[4, 0], cov=[[1, 0], [0, 1]], size=75) X_2 = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean=[6, 6], cov=[[2, 0], [0, 2]], size=250) X_3 = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean=[1, 5], cov=[[1, 0], [0, 2]], size=20) df = np.concatenate([X_1, X_2, X_3]) # Run kmeans km = KMeans(n_clusters=3) km.fit(df) labels = km.predict(df) centroids = km.cluster_centers_ # Plot the data fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 10)) ax[0].scatter(X_1[:, 0], X_1[:, 1]) ax[0].scatter(X_2[:, 0], X_2[:, 1]) ax[0].scatter(X_3[:, 0], X_3[:, 1]) ax[0].set_aspect('equal') ax[1].scatter(df[:, 0], df[:, 1], c=labels) ax[1].scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], marker='o', c=\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, alpha=1, s=200, edgecolor='k') for i, c in enumerate(centroids): ax[1].scatter(c[0], c[1], marker='$%d$' % i, s=50, alpha=1, edgecolor='r') ax[1].set_aspect('equal') plt.tight_layout()     Looks like kmeans couldn't figure out the clusters correctly. Since it tries to minimize the within-cluster variation, it gives more weight to bigger clusters than smaller ones. In other words, data points in smaller clusters may be left away from the centroid in order to focus more on the larger cluster.\nLast, we'll generate data that have complicated geometric shapes such as moons and circles within each other and test kmeans on both of the datasets.\n# Cricles X1 = make_circles(factor=0.5, noise=0.05, n_samples=1500) # Moons X2 = make_moons(n_samples=1500, noise=0.05) fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2) for i, X in enumerate([X1, X2]): fig.set_size_inches(18, 7) km = KMeans(n_clusters=2) km.fit(X[0]) labels = km.predict(X[0]) centroids = km.cluster_centers_ ax[i].scatter(X[0][:, 0], X[0][:, 1], c=labels) ax[i].scatter(centroids[0, 0], centroids[0, 1], marker='*', s=400, c='r') ax[i].scatter(centroids[1, 0], centroids[1, 1], marker='+', s=300, c='green') plt.suptitle('Simulated data', y=1.05, fontsize=22, fontweight='semibold') plt.tight_layout()     As expected, kmeans couldn't figure out the correct clusters for both datasets. However, we can help kmeans perfectly cluster these kind of datasets if we use kernel methods. The idea is we transform to higher dimensional representation that make the data linearly separable (the same idea that we use in SVMs). Different kinds of algorithms work very well in such scenarios such as SpectralClustering, see below:\n# Cricles X1 = make_circles(factor=0.5, noise=0.05, n_samples=1500) # Moons X2 = make_moons(n_samples=1500, noise=0.05) fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2) for i, X in enumerate([X1, X2]): fig.set_size_inches(18, 7) sp = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2, affinity='nearest_neighbors') sp.fit(X[0]) labels = sp.labels_ ax[i].scatter(X[0][:, 0], X[0][:, 1], c=labels) plt.suptitle('Simulated data', y=1.05, fontsize=22, fontweight='semibold') plt.tight_layout()      Conclusion \nKmeans clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms and usually the first thing practitioners apply when solving clustering tasks to get an idea of the structure of the dataset. The goal of kmeans is to group data points into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. It does a very good job when the clusters have a kind of spherical shapes. However, it suffers as the geometric shapes of clusters deviates from spherical shapes. Moreover, it also doesn't learn the number of clusters from the data and requires it to be pre-defined. To be a good practitioner, it's good to know the assumptions behind algorithms/methods so that you would have a pretty good idea about the strength and weakness of each method. This will help you decide when to use each method and under what circumstances. In this post, we covered both strength, weaknesses, and some evaluation methods related to kmeans.\nBelow are the main takeaways:\n Scale/standardize the data when applying kmeans algorithm. Elbow method in selecting number of clusters doesn't usually work because the error function is monotonically decreasing for all $k$s. Kmeans gives more weight to the bigger clusters. Kmeans assumes spherical shapes of clusters (with radius equal to the distance between the centroid and the furthest data point) and doesn't work well when clusters are in different shapes such as elliptical clusters. If there is overlapping between clusters, kmeans doesn't have an intrinsic measure for uncertainty for the examples belong to the overlapping region in order to determine for which cluster to assign each data point. Kmeans may still cluster the data even if it can't be clustered such as data that comes from uniform distributions.

On each iteration, we randomly shut down some neurons (units) on each layer and don't use those neurons in both forward propagation and back-propagation. Since the units that will be dropped out on each iteration will be random, the learning algorithm will have no idea which neurons will be shut down on every iteration; therefore, force the learning algorithm to spread out the weights and not focus on some specific feattures (units). Moreover, dropout help improving generalization error by:\n Since we drop some units on each iteration, this will lead to smaller network which in turns means simpler network (regularization). Can be seen as an approximation to bagging techniques. Each iteration can be viewed as different model since we're dropping randomly different units on each layer. This means that the error would be the average of errors from all different models (iterations). Therefore, averaging errors from different models especially if those errors are uncorrelated would reduce the overall errors. In the worst case where errors are perfectly correlated, averaging among all models won't help at all; however, we know that in practice errors have some degree of uncorrelation. As result, it will always improve generalization error.  We can use different probabilities on each layer; however, the output layer would always have keep_prob = 1 and the input layer has high keep_prob such as 0.9 or 1. If a hidden layer has keep_prob = 0.8, this means that; on each iteration, each unit has 80% probablitity of being included and 20% probability of being dropped out.\nDropout is used a lot in computer vision problems because we have a lot of features and not a lot of data. Also, features (pixels) next to each other usually don't add a lot of information. Therefore, models always suffer from overfitting.\nTo illustrate how dropout helps us reduce generalization error, we'll use the same dataset we've used in the previous posts. The dataset has images for cats and non-cat. We'll try to build a neural network to classify if the image has cat or not. Each image is 64 x 64 pixels on RGB scale.

Note that this is just an illustrative example to show the effectiveness of the dropout technique. We chose an arbitrary probabilities in this example; however, we can tune the dropout probabilities on each layer to yield the best validation loss and accuracy.\nConclusion  Dropout is a very effective regularization technique that is used a lot in Convolutional Neural Networks. Below are some takeaways:\n Set keep_prob = 1 when using gradient checking; otherwise, it won't work. Dropout is used only during training. Don't use it when testing/predicting new examples. The lowest the keep_prob $\\rightarrow$ the simpler the neural network. As keep_prob decreases, the bias increases and the variance decreases. Therefore, layers with more neurons are expected to have lower keep_prob to avoid overfitting. It's computationally a cheap way to improve generalization error and help resolve overfitting. One can tune keep_prob to get the best results out of the task at hand.  The source code that created this post can be found here.

It gives us an estimate on the performance of the model on unseen data. Test error is decomposed into 3 parts (see above figure): Variance, Squared-Bias, and Irreducible Error. Models with high bias are not complex enough (too simple) for the data and tend to underfit. The simplest model is taking the average (mode) of target variable and assign it to all predictions. On the contrary, models with high variance overfit the training data by closely follow (mimick) the training data where the learning algorithm will follow the signal and the noise. Note that as the complexity (flexibility) of the model increases → the model will become less interpretable such as Neural Networks. Below is the bias-variance decomposition:\n\\(MSE = E(y - \\widehat{y})^2\\) \\( = E(y - f + f - \\widehat{y})^2\\) \\( = E((y - f)^2 + 2(y - f)(f - \\widehat{y}) + (f - \\widehat{y})^2); \\quad substitute\\ y = f + \\epsilon\\) \\( = E((\\epsilon + f - f)^2 + 2(\\epsilon + f - f)(f - \\widehat{y}) + (f - \\widehat{y})^2)\\) \\( = E(\\epsilon)^2 + E(\\epsilon)E(f - \\widehat{y}) + E(f - \\widehat{y})^2; \\quad where\\ E(\\epsilon) = 0\\) \\( = E(\\epsilon)^2 + E(f - \\widehat{y})^2;\\quad add\\ and\\ subtract\\ E(\\widehat{y})\\) \\( = E(\\epsilon)^2 + E(f - E(\\widehat{y}) + E(\\widehat{y}) - \\widehat{y})^2\\) \\( = E(\\epsilon)^2 + E(f - E(\\widehat{y}))^2 + E(\\widehat{y} - E(\\widehat{y}))^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow MSE = var(\\widehat{y}) + (Bias(\\widehat{y}))^2 + var(\\epsilon)\\) Where:\n $var(\\epsilon)$: Irreducible error that resulted from omitted features and unmeasured variation with each example. $Bias(\\widehat{y})$: Error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem with a simple model. $var(\\widehat{y})$: amount by which $\\widehat{y}$ would change if we estimated it using different data set.  Therefore, we can control only the variance and the bias of the $\\widehat{y}$ BUT NOT irreducible error. As a result, our job is to try to estimate the right level of complexity to achieve the lowest test error.\nRegularization  Regularization adds stability to the learning algorithm by making it less sensitive to the training data and processes. Since we don't know and have no access to the true function that we can use to compare our estimated function with it, the best strategy would be to build a very complex model that fits the training data really well (overfitting) and regularize it so that it would have a good generalization (test) error. When using regularization, we try to reduce the generalization error and that may lead to increase the training error in the process which is okay because what we care about is how well the model generalizes. With regularization, we try to bring back the very complex model that suffers from overfitting to a good model by increasing bias and reducing variance. This builds on the assumption that complex model has large parameters and simple model has small parameters.\nBelow are some methods used for regularization:\n L2 Parameter Regularization It's also known as weight decay. This method adds L2 norm penalty to the objective function to drive the weights towards the origin. Even though this method shrinks all weights by the same proportion towards zero; however, it will never make any weight to be exactly zero. L1 Parameter Regularization (Lasso) It can be seen as a feature selection method because; in contrast to L2 regularization, some weights will be actually zero. It shrinks all weights by the same amount by adding L1 norm penalty to the objective function. Dropout Dropout can be seen as an approximation to bagging techniques. On each iteration, we randomly shut down some neurons on each layer and don't use those neurons in both forward propagation and back-propagation. This will force the neural network to spread out weights and not focus on specific neurons because it will never know which neurons will show up on each iteration. Therefore, it can be seen as training different model on each iteration. Also, since we drop some neurons on each iteration, this will lead to smaller network which in turns means simpler network. Augmentation Add fake data by using the training examples and adding distortions to them such as rescaling and rotating the images in the case of image recognition. The idea here is that it's always better to train the model on more data to achieve better performance. Note that augmented examples don't add much information to the model as much as independent examples do but still it's a valid alternative when collecting more data is not feasible. Early Stopping This method tries to optimize the cost function and regularize it so that it would have lower generalization error. The way it works is that on each iteration we record the validation error. If the validation error improves, we store a copy of the parameters and will continue until the optimization algorithm terminates. It's a good method if computational time and resources is an issue for us.  In this post, we'll cover L2 parameter regularization.\nL2 Parameter Regularization  We normally don't regularize bias and regularize weights only. We can use hessian matrix and it's eigenvalues and eigenvectors to see the sensitivity of the weights to the weight decay. The weight $w_i$ will be rescaled using $\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\lambda_i + \\alpha}$ where $\\lambda_i$ (eigenvalue) measures the sensitivity of hessian matrix in that direction (eigenvector) and $\\alpha$ is the regularized hyperparameter. Therefore,\n If $\\lambda_i \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \\alpha$, the cost function is very sensitive in that direction and the corresponding weight reduces the cost significantly $\\Rightarrow$ don't decay (shrink) much. If $\\lambda_i \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \\alpha$, the cost function is not sensitive in that direction and the corresponding weight doesn't reduce the cost significantly $\\Rightarrow$ decay (shrink) away towards zero.  The objective function (binary cross-entropy) would then change from:\n\\[J = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m} \\large(y^{(i)}\\log(a^{[L](i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})\\log(1- a^{[L](i)}) \\large)\\tag{1}\\]\nTo:\n\\[J\\_{regularized} = \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m} \\large(y^{(i)}\\log(a^{[L](i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})\\log(1- a^{[L](i)}) \\large)}\\_\\text{cross-entropy cost} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum\\limits_{l=1}^L \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n^l} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n^{l-1}} W_{j,i}^{[l]2} }_\\text{L2 regularization cost} \\tag{2}\\]\nAlso, the new gradients and the update equation would be:\n\\(\\nabla_w J_{regularized} = \\nabla_w J + \\frac{\\lambda}{m}w\\) \\(w = w - \\alpha\\nabla_w J - \\alpha\\frac{\\lambda}{m}w\\) \\(\\Rightarrow w = w\\underbrace{(1 - \\alpha\\frac{\\lambda}{m})}_\\text{weight decay} - \\nabla J\\)\nNote that here $\\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\\lambda$ is the regularized hyperparameter. As $\\lambda$ increases, the bias increases (and the model becomes less flexible) with the following extreme cases (see figure 2):\n $\\lambda = 0$, no regularization. $\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty$, model becomes very simple where all weights are essentially zero. In the case of regression, we would end-up with the intercept only which is equal to the average of the target variable.    Model complexity (underfitting/overfitting) as a function of regularization parameter $\\lambda$.   It sometimes maybe helpful to see how L2 parameter regularization works using normal equation. The normal quation is: \\(W = (X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}X^TY\\tag{3}\\) This means that:\n Adding $\\lambda$ to the variance would decrease the weight since $w_i = \\frac{cov_{x, y}}{\\sigma^2_x}$. Even if $X^TX$ is not invertible, adding $\\lambda$ to each feature will make it full rank matrix $\\Rightarrow$ invertible.  To illustrate how regularization helps us reduce generalization error, we'll use the cats_vs_dogs dataset. The dataset has images for cats and dogs. We'll try to build a neural network to classify if the image has a cat or a dog. Each image is 64 x 64 pixels on RGB scale.\nWe'll be using functions we wrote in \u0026quot;Coding Neural Network - Forward Propagation and Backpropagation\u0026quot; post to initialize parameters, compute forward propagation, cross-entropy cost, gradients, etc.\nLet's import the data and take a look at the shape as well as a sample of a cat image from the training set.\n# Loading packages import sys import h5py import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import seaborn as sns sys.path.append(\u0026quot;../scripts/\u0026quot;) from coding_neural_network_from_scratch import (initialize_parameters, L_model_forward, compute_cost, relu_gradient, sigmoid_gradient, tanh_gradient, update_parameters, accuracy) from gradient_checking import dictionary_to_vector from load_dataset import load_dataset_catvsdog %matplotlib inline sns.set_context(\u0026quot;notebook\u0026quot;) plt.style.use(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;) plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 6)  # Import training data train_dataset = h5py.File(\u0026quot;../data/train_catvnoncat.h5\u0026quot;) X_train = np.array(train_dataset[\u0026quot;train_set_x\u0026quot;]) Y_train = np.array(train_dataset[\u0026quot;train_set_y\u0026quot;]) # Plot a sample image plt.imshow(X_train[50]) plt.axis(\u0026quot;off\u0026quot;); # Import test data test_dataset = h5py.File(\u0026quot;../data/test_catvnoncat.h5\u0026quot;) X_test = np.array(test_dataset[\u0026quot;test_set_x\u0026quot;]) Y_test = np.array(test_dataset[\u0026quot;test_set_y\u0026quot;]) # Transform data X_train = X_train.reshape(209, -1).T X_train = X_train / 255 Y_train = Y_train.reshape(-1, 209) X_test = X_test.reshape(50, -1).T X_test = X_test / 255 Y_test = Y_test.reshape(-1, 50) # print the new shape of both training and test datasets print(\u0026quot;Training data dimensions:\u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;X's dimension: {}, Y's dimension: {}\u0026quot;.format(X_train.shape, Y_train.shape)) print(\u0026quot;Test data dimensions:\u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;X's dimension: {}, Y's dimension: {}\u0026quot;.format(X_test.shape, Y_test.shape))  Training data dimensions: X's dimension: (12288, 209), Y's dimension: (1, 209) Test data dimensions: X's dimension: (12288, 50), Y's dimension: (1, 50)    Sample image.

Since we don't know true distribution of the data, empirical risk, which is based of empirical distribution, is prone to overfitting. Therefore, the best strategy is to fit training data really well and then use a regularization technique so that the model generalizes well. L2 parameter regularization along with Dropout are two of the most widely used regularization technique in machine learning.\n One of the implicit assumptions of regularization techniques such as L2 and L1 parameter regularization is that the value of the parameters should be zero and try to shrink all parameters towards zero. It's meant to avoid following the training data very well which makes the learning algorithm picks some noise that is not helpful when applied on unseen data. The value of $\\lambda$ should be tuned to get the best generalization error. We typically use validation set when comparing models with values for $\\lambda$s and pick the one with the lowest validation error. Only use regularization if the model suffers from overfitting, i.e training error \u0026lt;\u0026lt; validation error. If after using regularization the validation error is still high, then we're most likely in the underfitting region. In other words, our model is still too simple and already has high bias. Therefore, add complexity to the model and then use regularization. Since the majority of tasks we try to solve don't have enough data (or expensive to collect more data), overfitting will be more prevalent in Deep Learning than underfitting given the complexity of neural networks.

Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and converges to acceptable solution regardless of the parameters initialization such as gradient descent applied to logistic regression. Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and applied to a set of problems that have non-convex loss functions such as neural networks.

In this post, we'll look at three different cases of parameters' initialization and see how this affects the error rate:\n Initialize all parameters to zero.

Cost curve using zero intialization method.   As the cost curve shows, the neural network didn't learn anything! That is because of symmetry between all neurons which leads to all neurons have the same update on every iteration. Therefore, regardless of how many iterations we run the optimization algorithms, all the neurons would still get the same update and no learning would happen. As a result, we must break symmetry when initializing parameters so that the model would start learning on each update of the gradient descent.\nInitializing parameters with big random values  There is no big difference if the random values are initialized from standard normal distribution or uniform distribution so we'll use standard normal distribution in our examples. Also, we'll multiply the random values by a big number such as 10 to show that initializing parameters to big values may cause our optimization to have higher error rates (and even diverge in some cases). Let's now train our neural network where all weight matrices have been intitialized using the following formula: np.random.randn() * 10\n# train NN with random initialization parameters layers_dims = [X.shape[0], 5, 5, 1] parameters = model(X, Y, layers_dims, hidden_layers_activation_fn=\u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;, initialization_method=\u0026quot;random\u0026quot;) accuracy(X, parameters, Y,\u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;)  The cost after 100 iterations is: 1.2413142077549013 The cost after 200 iterations is: 1.1258751902393416 The cost after 300 iterations is: 1.0989052435267657 The cost after 400 iterations is: 1.0840966471282327 The cost after 500 iterations is: 1.0706953292105978 The cost after 600 iterations is: 1.0574847320236294 The cost after 700 iterations is: 1.0443168708889223 The cost after 800 iterations is: 1.031157857251139 The cost after 900 iterations is: 1.0179838815204902 The cost after 1000 iterations is: 1.004767088515343 'The accuracy rate is: 55.00%.'

Random initialization here is helping but still the loss function has high value and may take long time to converge and achieve a significantly low value.\nInitializing parameters based on He and Xavier recommendations  We'll explore two initialization methods:\n Kaiming He method is best applied when activation function applied on hidden layers is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). so that the weight on each hidden layer would have the following variance:  \\(var(W^l) = \\frac{2}{n^{l - 1}}\\) We can achieve this by multiplying the random values from standard normal distribution by $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{number\\ of\\ units\\ in \\ previous\\ layer}}$\n Xavier method is best applied when activation function applied on hidden layers is Hyperbolic Tangent so that the weight on each hidden layer would have the following variance:  \\(var(W^l) = \\frac{1}{n^{l - 1}}\\) We can achieve this by multiplying the random values from standard normal distribution by $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{number\\ of\\ units\\ in \\ previous\\ layer}}$\nWe'll train the network using both methods and look at the results.\n# train NN where all parameters were initialized based on He recommendation layers_dims = [X.shape[0], 5, 5, 1] parameters = model(X, Y, layers_dims, hidden_layers_activation_fn=\u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;, initialization_method=\u0026quot;he\u0026quot;) accuracy(X, parameters, Y, \u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;)  The cost after 100 iterations is: 0.6300611704834093 The cost after 200 iterations is: 0.49092836452522753 The cost after 300 iterations is: 0.46579423512433943 The cost after 400 iterations is: 0.6516254192289226 The cost after 500 iterations is: 0.32487779301799485 The cost after 600 iterations is: 0.4631461605716059 The cost after 700 iterations is: 0.8050310690163623 The cost after 800 iterations is: 0.31739195517372376 The cost after 900 iterations is: 0.3094592175030812 The cost after 1000 iterations is: 0.19934509244449203 'The accuracy rate is: 99.00%.'

Cost curve using Xavier initialization method.   As shown from applying the four methods, parameters' initial values play a huge role in achieving low cost values as well as converging and achieve lower training error rates. The same would apply to test error rate if we had test data.\nConclusion  Deep Learning frameworks make it easier to choose between different initialization methods without worrying about implementing it ourselves. Nonetheless, it's important to understand the critical role initial values of the parameters in the overall performance of the network. Below are some key takeaways:\n Well chosen initialization values of parameters leads to:  Speed up convergence of gradient descent. Increase the likelihood of gradient descent to find lower training and generalization error rates.  Because we're dealing with iterative optimization algorithms with non-convex loss function, different initializations lead to different results. Random initialization is used to break symmetry and make sure different hidden units can learn different things. Don't initialize to values that are too large. Kaiming He (He) initialization works well for neural networks with ReLU activation function. Xavier initialization works well for neural networks with Hyperbolic Tangent activation function.

However, implementing backpropagation from scratch is usually more prune to bugs/errors. Therefore, it's necessary before running the neural network on training data to check if our implementation of backpropagation is correct. Before we start, let's revisit what back-propagation is: We loop over the nodes in reverse topological order starting at the final node to compute the derivative of the cost with respect to each edge's node tail. In other words, we compute the derivative of cost function with respect to all parameters, i.e $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}$ where $\\theta$ represents the parameters of the model.\nThe way to test our implementation is by computing numerical gradients and compare it with gradients from backpropagation (analytical). There are two way of computing numerical gradients:\n Right-hand form:  \\[\\frac{J(\\theta + \\epsilon) - J(\\theta)}{\\epsilon}\\tag{1}\\]\n Two-sided form (see figure 2):  \\[\\frac{J(\\theta + \\epsilon) - J(\\theta - \\epsilon)}{2 \\epsilon}\\tag{2}\\]\n  Two-sided numerical gradients.   Two-sided form of approximating the derivative is closer than the right-hand form. Let's illustrate that with the following example using the function $f(x) = x^2$ by taking its derivative at $x = 3$.\n Analytical derivative:  \\[\\nabla_x f(x) = 2x\\ \\Rightarrow\\nabla_x f(3) = 6\\]\n Two-sided numerical derivative:  \\[\\frac{(3 + 1e-2)^2 - (3 - 1e-2)^2}{2 * 1e-2} = 5.999999999999872\\]\n Right-hand numerical derivative:  \\[\\frac{(3 + 1e-2)^2 - 3^2}{1e-2} = 6.009999999999849\\]\nAs we see above, the difference between analytical derivative and two-sided numerical gradient is almost zero; however, the difference between analytical derivative and right-sided derivative is 0.01. Therefore, we'll use two-sided epsilon method to compute the numerical gradients.\nIn addition, we'll normalize the difference between numerical. gradients and analytical gradients using the following formula:\n\\[\\frac{\\|grad - grad\\_{approx}\\|_2}{\\|grad\\|_2 + \\|grad\\_{approx}\\|_2}\\tag{3}\\]\nIf the difference is $\\leq 10^{-7}$, then our implementation is fine; otherwise, we have a mistake somewhere and have to go back and revisit backpropagation code.\nBelow are the steps needed to implement gradient checking:\n Pick random number of examples from training data to use it when computing both numerical and analytical gradients.  Don't use all examples in the training data because gradient checking is very slow.  Initialize parameters. Compute forward propagation and the cross-entropy cost. Compute the gradients using our back-propagation implementation. Compute the numerical gradients using the two-sided epsilon method.

Our implementation is correct 👍\nConclusion  Below are some key takeaways:\n Two-sided numerical gradient approximates the analytical gradients more closely than right-side form. Since gradient checking is very slow:  Apply it on one or few training examples. Turn it off when training neural network after making sure that backpropagation's implementation is correct.  Gradient checking doesn't work when applying drop-out method. Use keep-prob = 1 to check gradient checking and then change it when training neural network. Epsilon = $10e-7$ is a common value used for the difference between analytical gradient and numerical gradient. If the difference is less than 10e-7 then the implementation of backpropagation is correct. Thanks to Deep Learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch, we may find ourselves rarely implement backpropagation because such frameworks compute that for us; however, it's a good practice to understand what happens under the hood to become a good Deep Learning practitioner.

The way neural network learns the true function is by building complex representations on top of simple ones. On each hidden layer, the neural network learns new feature space by first compute the affine (linear) transformations of the given inputs and then apply non-linear function which in turn will be the input of the next layer. This process will continue until we reach the output layer. Therefore, we can define neural network as information flows from inputs through hidden layers towards the output. For a 3-layers neural network, the learned function would be: $f(x) = f_3(f_2(f_1(x)))$ where:\n $f_1(x)$: Function learned on first hidden layer $f_2(x)$: Function learned on second hidden layer $f_3(x)$: Function learned on output layer  Therefore, on each layer we learn different representation that gets more complicated with later hidden layers.Below is an example of a 3-layers neural network (we don't count input layer):\n  Neural Network with two hidden layers.   For example, computers can't understand images directly and don't know what to do with pixels data. However, a neural network can build a simple representation of the image in the early hidden layers that identifies edges. Given the first hidden layer output, it can learn corners and contours. Given the second hidden layer, it can learn parts such as nose. Finally, it can learn the object identity.\nSince truth is never linear and representation is very critical to the performance of a machine learning algorithm, neural network can help us build very complex models and leave it to the algorithm to learn such representations without worrying about feature engineering that takes practitioners very long time and effort to curate a good representation.\nThe post has two parts:\n Coding the neural network: This entails writing all the helper functions that would allow us to implement a multi-layer neural network. While doing so, I'll explain the theoretical parts whenever possible and give some advices on implementations. Application: We'll implement the neural network we coded in the first part on image recognition problem to see if the network we built will be able to detect if the image has a cat or a dog and see it working :)  This post will be the first in a series of posts that cover implementing neural network in numpy including gradient checking, parameter initialization, L2 regularization, dropout. The code that created this post can be found here.\n# Import packages import h5py import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import seaborn as sns  \nI. Coding The Neural Network  Forward Propagation  The input $X$ provides the initial information that then propagates to the hidden units at each layer and finally produce the output $\\widehat{Y}$. The architecture of the network entails determining its depth, width, and activation functions used on each layer. Depth is the number of hidden layers. Width is the number of units (nodes) on each hidden layer since we don't control neither input layer nor output layer dimensions. There are quite a few set of activation functions such Rectified Linear Unit, Sigmoid, Hyperbolic tangent, etc. Research has proven that deeper networks outperform networks with more hidden units. Therefore, it's always better and won't hurt to train a deeper network (with diminishing returns).\nLets first introduce some notations that will be used throughout the post:\n $W^l$: Weights matrix for the $l^{th}$ layer $b^l$: Bias vector for the $l^{th}$ layer $Z^l$: Linear (affine) transformations of given inputs for the $l^{th}$ layer $g^l$: Activation function applied on the $l^{th}$ layer $A^l$: Post-activation output for the $l^{th}$ layer $dW^l$: Derivative of the cost function w.r.t $W^l$ ($\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial W^l}$) $db^l$: Derivative of the cost function w.r.t $b^l$ ($\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial b^l})$) $dZ^l$: Derivative of the cost function w.r.t $Z^l$ ($\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial Z^l}$) $dA^l$: Derivative of the cost function w.r.t $A^l$ ($\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial A^l}$) $n^l$: Number of units (nodes) of the $l^{th}$ layer $m$: Number of examples $L$: Number of layers in the network (not including the input layer)  Next, we'll write down the dimensions of a multi-layer neural network in the general form to help us in matrix multiplication because one of the major challenges in implementing a neural network is getting the dimensions right.\n $W^l$, $dW^l$: Number of units (nodes) in $l^{th}$ layer x Number of units (nodes) in $l - 1$ layer $b^l$, $db^l$: Number of units (nodes) in $l^{th}$ layer x 1 $Z^l$, $dZ^l$: Number of units (nodes) in $l^{th}$ layer x number of examples $A^l$, $dA^l$: Number of units (nodes) in $l^{th}$ layer x number of examples  The two equations we need to implement forward propagations are:\n\\(Z^l = W^lA^{l - 1} + b ^l\\tag1\\) \\(A^l = g^l(Z^l) = g^l(W^lA^{l - 1} + b ^l)\\tag2\\) These computations will take place on each layer.\nParameters Initialization \nWe'll first initialize the weight matrices and the bias vectors. It's important to note that we shouldn't initialize all the parameters to zero because doing so will lead the gradients to be equal and on each iteration the output would be the same and the learning algorithm won't learn anything. Therefore, it's important to randomly initialize the parameters to values between 0 and 1. It's also recommended to multiply the random values by small scalar such as 0.01 to make the activation units active and be on the regions where activation functions' derivatives are not close to zero.\n# Initialize parameters def initialize_parameters(layers_dims): np.random.seed(1) parameters = {} L = len(layers_dims) for l in range(1, L): parameters[\u0026quot;W\u0026quot; + str(l)] = np.random.randn( layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l - 1]) * 0.01 parameters[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot; + str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l], 1)) assert parameters[\u0026quot;W\u0026quot; + str(l)].shape == ( layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l - 1]) assert parameters[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot; + str(l)].shape == (layers_dims[l], 1) return parameters  Activation Functions \nThere is no definitive guide for which activation function works best on specific problems. It's a trial and error process where one should try different set of functions and see which one works best on the problem at hand. We'll cover 4 of the most commonly used activation functions:\n Sigmoid function ($\\sigma$): $g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$. It's recommended to be used only on the output layer so that we can easily interpret the output as probabilities since it has restricted output between 0 and 1. One of the main disadvantages for using sigmoid function on hidden layers is that the gradient is very close to zero over a large portion of its domain which makes it slow and harder for the learning algorithm to learn. Hyperbolic Tangent function: $g(z) = \\frac{e^z - e{-z}}{ez + e^{-z}}$. It's superior to sigmoid function in which the mean of its output is very close to zero, which in other words center the output of the activation units around zero and make the range of values very small which means faster to learn. The disadvantage that it shares with sigmoid function is that the gradient is very small on good portion of the domain. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): $g(z) = max(0, z)$. The models that are close to linear are easy to optimize. Since ReLU shares a lot of the properties of linear functions, it tends to work well on most of the problems. The only issue is that the derivative is not defined at $z = 0$, which we can overcome by assigning the derivative to 0 at $z = 0$. However, this means that for $z\\leq 0$ the gradient is zero and again can't learn. Leaky Rectified Linear Unit: $g(z) = max(\\alpha*z, z)$. It overcomes the zero gradient issue from ReLU and assigns $\\alpha$ which is a small value for $z\\leq 0$.  If you're not sure which activation function to choose, start with ReLU. Next, we'll implement the above activation functions and draw a graph for each one to make it easier to see the domain and range of each function.\n# Define activation functions that will be used in forward propagation def sigmoid(Z): A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-Z)) return A, Z def tanh(Z): A = np.tanh(Z) return A, Z def relu(Z): A = np.maximum(0, Z) return A, Z def leaky_relu(Z): A = np.maximum(0.1 * Z, Z) return A, Z  # Plot the 4 activation functions z = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100) # Computes post-activation outputs A_sigmoid, z = sigmoid(z) A_tanh, z = tanh(z) A_relu, z = relu(z) A_leaky_relu, z = leaky_relu(z) # Plot sigmoid plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8)) plt.subplot(2, 2, 1) plt.plot(z, A_sigmoid, label = \u0026quot;Function\u0026quot;) plt.plot(z, A_sigmoid * (1 - A_sigmoid), label = \u0026quot;Derivative\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc = \u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;) plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;z\u0026quot;) plt.ylabel(r\u0026quot;$\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;Sigmoid Function\u0026quot;, fontsize = 16) # Plot tanh plt.subplot(2, 2, 2) plt.plot(z, A_tanh, 'b', label = \u0026quot;Function\u0026quot;) plt.plot(z, 1 - np.square(A_tanh), 'r',label = \u0026quot;Derivative\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc = \u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;) plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;z\u0026quot;) plt.ylabel(r\u0026quot;$\\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}$\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;Hyperbolic Tangent Function\u0026quot;, fontsize = 16) # plot relu plt.subplot(2, 2, 3) plt.plot(z, A_relu, 'g') plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;z\u0026quot;) plt.ylabel(r\u0026quot;$max\\{0, z\\}$\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;ReLU Function\u0026quot;, fontsize = 16) # plot leaky relu plt.subplot(2, 2, 4) plt.plot(z, A_leaky_relu, 'y') plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;z\u0026quot;) plt.ylabel(r\u0026quot;$max\\{0.1z, z\\}$\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;Leaky ReLU Function\u0026quot;, fontsize = 16) plt.tight_layout();    Activation functions and their derivatives.   Feed Forward \nGiven its inputs from previous layer, each unit computes affine transformation $z = W^Tx + b$ and then apply an activation function $g(z)$ such as ReLU element-wise. During the process, we'll store (cache) all variables computed and used on each layer to be used in back-propagation. We'll write first two helper functions that will be used in the L-model forward propagation to make it easier to debug. Keep in mind that on each layer, we may have different activation function.\n# Define helper functions that will be used in L-model forward prop def linear_forward(A_prev, W, b): Z = np.dot(W, A_prev) + b cache = (A_prev, W, b) return Z, cache def linear_activation_forward(A_prev, W, b, activation_fn): assert activation_fn == \u0026quot;sigmoid\u0026quot; or activation_fn == \u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot; or \\ activation_fn == \u0026quot;relu\u0026quot; if activation_fn == \u0026quot;sigmoid\u0026quot;: Z, linear_cache = linear_forward(A_prev, W, b) A, activation_cache = sigmoid(Z) elif activation_fn == \u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;: Z, linear_cache = linear_forward(A_prev, W, b) A, activation_cache = tanh(Z) elif activation_fn == \u0026quot;relu\u0026quot;: Z, linear_cache = linear_forward(A_prev, W, b) A, activation_cache = relu(Z) assert A.shape == (W.shape[0], A_prev.shape[1]) cache = (linear_cache, activation_cache) return A, cache def L_model_forward(X, parameters, hidden_layers_activation_fn=\u0026quot;relu\u0026quot;): A = X caches = [] L = len(parameters) // 2 for l in range(1, L): A_prev = A A, cache = linear_activation_forward( A_prev, parameters[\u0026quot;W\u0026quot; + str(l)], parameters[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot; + str(l)], activation_fn=hidden_layers_activation_fn) caches.append(cache) AL, cache = linear_activation_forward( A, parameters[\u0026quot;W\u0026quot; + str(L)], parameters[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot; + str(L)], activation_fn=\u0026quot;sigmoid\u0026quot;) caches.append(cache) assert AL.shape == (1, X.shape[1]) return AL, caches  Cost \nWe'll use the binary Cross-Entropy cost. It uses the log-likelihood method to estimate its error. The cost is: \\(J(W, b) = -\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i = 1}^m\\big(y^ilog(\\widehat{y^i}) + (1 - y^i)log(1 - \\widehat{y^i}\\big)\\tag3\\) The above cost function is convex; however, neural network usually stuck on a local minimum and is not guaranteed to find the optimal parameters. We'll use here gradient-based learning.\n# Compute cross-entropy cost def compute_cost(AL, y): m = y.shape[1] cost = - (1 / m) * np.sum( np.multiply(y, np.log(AL)) + np.multiply(1 - y, np.log(1 - AL))) return cost  Back-Propagation  Allows the information to go back from the cost backward through the network in order to compute the gradient. Therefore, loop over the nodes starting at the final node in reverse topological order to compute the derivative of the final node output with respect to each edge's node tail. Doing so will help us know who is responsible for the most error and change the parameters in that direction. The following derivatives' formulas will help us write the back-propagate functions: \\(dA^L = \\frac{A^L - Y}{A^L(1 - A^L)}\\tag4\\) \\(dZ^L = A^L - Y\\tag5\\) \\(dW^l = \\frac{1}{m}dZ^l{A^{l - 1}}^T\\tag6\\) \\(db^l = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_i(dZ^l)\\tag7\\) \\(dA^{l - 1} = {W^l}^TdZ^l\\tag8\\) \\(dZ^{l} = dA^l*g^{'l}(Z^l)\\tag9\\) Since $b^l$ is always a vector, the sum would be across rows (since each column is an example).\n# Define derivative of activation functions w.r.t z that will be used in back-propagation def sigmoid_gradient(dA, Z): A, Z = sigmoid(Z) dZ = dA * A * (1 - A) return dZ def tanh_gradient(dA, Z): A, Z = tanh(Z) dZ = dA * (1 - np.square(A)) return dZ def relu_gradient(dA, Z): A, Z = relu(Z) dZ = np.multiply(dA, np.int64(A \u0026gt; 0)) return dZ # define helper functions that will be used in L-model back-prop def linear_backword(dZ, cache): A_prev, W, b = cache m = A_prev.shape[1] dW = (1 / m) * np.dot(dZ, A_prev.T) db = (1 / m) * np.sum(dZ, axis=1, keepdims=True) dA_prev = np.dot(W.T, dZ) assert dA_prev.shape == A_prev.shape assert dW.shape == W.shape assert db.shape == b.shape return dA_prev, dW, db def linear_activation_backward(dA, cache, activation_fn): linear_cache, activation_cache = cache if activation_fn == \u0026quot;sigmoid\u0026quot;: dZ = sigmoid_gradient(dA, activation_cache) dA_prev, dW, db = linear_backword(dZ, linear_cache) elif activation_fn == \u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;: dZ = tanh_gradient(dA, activation_cache) dA_prev, dW, db = linear_backword(dZ, linear_cache) elif activation_fn == \u0026quot;relu\u0026quot;: dZ = relu_gradient(dA, activation_cache) dA_prev, dW, db = linear_backword(dZ, linear_cache) return dA_prev, dW, db def L_model_backward(AL, y, caches, hidden_layers_activation_fn=\u0026quot;relu\u0026quot;): y = y.reshape(AL.shape) L = len(caches) grads = {} dAL = np.divide(AL - y, np.multiply(AL, 1 - AL)) grads[\u0026quot;dA\u0026quot; + str(L - 1)], grads[\u0026quot;dW\u0026quot; + str(L)], grads[ \u0026quot;db\u0026quot; + str(L)] = linear_activation_backward( dAL, caches[L - 1], \u0026quot;sigmoid\u0026quot;) for l in range(L - 1, 0, -1): current_cache = caches[l - 1] grads[\u0026quot;dA\u0026quot; + str(l - 1)], grads[\u0026quot;dW\u0026quot; + str(l)], grads[ \u0026quot;db\u0026quot; + str(l)] = linear_activation_backward( grads[\u0026quot;dA\u0026quot; + str(l)], current_cache, hidden_layers_activation_fn) return grads # define the function to update both weight matrices and bias vectors def update_parameters(parameters, grads, learning_rate): L = len(parameters) // 2 for l in range(1, L + 1): parameters[\u0026quot;W\u0026quot; + str(l)] = parameters[ \u0026quot;W\u0026quot; + str(l)] - learning_rate * grads[\u0026quot;dW\u0026quot; + str(l)] parameters[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot; + str(l)] = parameters[ \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; + str(l)] - learning_rate * grads[\u0026quot;db\u0026quot; + str(l)] return parameters  \nII. Application  The dataset that we'll be working on has 209 images. Each image is 64 x 64 pixels on RGB scale. We'll build a neural network to classify if the image has a cat or not. Therefore, $y^i \\in {0, 1}.$\n We'll first load the images. Show sample image for a cat. Reshape input matrix so that each column would be one example. Also, since each image is 64 x 64 x 3, we'll end up having 12,288 features for each image. Therefore, the input matrix would be 12,288 x 209. Standardize the data so that the gradients don't go out of control. Also, it will help hidden units have similar range of values. For now, we'll divide every pixel by 255 which shouldn't be an issue. However, it's better to standardize the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  # Import training dataset train_dataset = h5py.File(\u0026quot;../data/train_catvnoncat.h5\u0026quot;) X_train = np.array(train_dataset[\u0026quot;train_set_x\u0026quot;]) y_train = np.array(train_dataset[\u0026quot;train_set_y\u0026quot;]) test_dataset = h5py.File(\u0026quot;../data/test_catvnoncat.h5\u0026quot;) X_test = np.array(test_dataset[\u0026quot;test_set_x\u0026quot;]) y_test = np.array(test_dataset[\u0026quot;test_set_y\u0026quot;]) # print the shape of input data and label vector print(f\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Original dimensions:\\n{20 * '-'}\\nTraining: {X_train.shape}, {y_train.shape} Test: {X_test.shape}, {y_test.shape}\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # plot cat image plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.imshow(X_train[50]) plt.axis(\u0026quot;off\u0026quot;); # Transform input data and label vector X_train = X_train.reshape(209, -1).T y_train = y_train.reshape(-1, 209) X_test = X_test.reshape(50, -1).T y_test = y_test.reshape(-1, 50) # standarize the data X_train = X_train / 255 X_test = X_test / 255 print(f\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\\nNew dimensions:\\n{15 * '-'}\\nTraining: {X_train.shape}, {y_train.shape} Test: {X_test.shape}, {y_test.shape}\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)  Original dimensions: -------------------- Training: (209, 64, 64, 3), (209,) Test: (50, 64, 64, 3), (50,) New dimensions: --------------- Training: (12288, 209), (1, 209) Test: (12288, 50), (1, 50)    Sample image.   Now, our dataset is ready to be used and test our neural network implementation.

Finally we'll use the parameters we get from both neural networks to classify training examples and compute the training accuracy rates for each version to see which activation function works best on this problem.\n# Setting layers dims layers_dims = [X_train.shape[0], 5, 5, 1] # NN with tanh activation fn parameters_tanh = L_layer_model( X_train, y_train, layers_dims, learning_rate=0.03, num_iterations=3000, hidden_layers_activation_fn=\u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;) # Print the accuracy accuracy(X_test, parameters_tanh, y_test, activation_fn=\u0026quot;tanh\u0026quot;)  The cost after 100 iterations is: 0.6556 The cost after 200 iterations is: 0.6468 The cost after 300 iterations is: 0.6447 The cost after 400 iterations is: 0.6441 The cost after 500 iterations is: 0.6440 The cost after 600 iterations is: 0.6440 The cost after 700 iterations is: 0.6440 The cost after 800 iterations is: 0.6439 The cost after 900 iterations is: 0.6439 The cost after 1000 iterations is: 0.6439 The cost after 1100 iterations is: 0.6439 The cost after 1200 iterations is: 0.6439 The cost after 1300 iterations is: 0.6438 The cost after 1400 iterations is: 0.6438 The cost after 1500 iterations is: 0.6437 The cost after 1600 iterations is: 0.6434 The cost after 1700 iterations is: 0.6429 The cost after 1800 iterations is: 0.6413 The cost after 1900 iterations is: 0.6361 The cost after 2000 iterations is: 0.6124 The cost after 2100 iterations is: 0.5112 The cost after 2200 iterations is: 0.5288 The cost after 2300 iterations is: 0.4312 The cost after 2400 iterations is: 0.3821 The cost after 2500 iterations is: 0.3387 The cost after 2600 iterations is: 0.2349 The cost after 2700 iterations is: 0.2206 The cost after 2800 iterations is: 0.1927 The cost after 2900 iterations is: 0.4669 The cost after 3000 iterations is: 0.1040 'The accuracy rate is: 68.00%.'

Please note that the accuracy rates above are expected to overestimate the generalization accuracy rates.\nConclusion  The purpose of this post is to code Deep Neural Network step-by-step and explain the important concepts while doing that. We don't really care about the accuracy rate at this moment since there are tons of things we could've done to increase the accuracy which would be the subject of following posts. Below are some takeaways:\n Even if neural network can represent any function, it may fail to learn for two reasons:  The optimization algorithm may fail to find the best value for the parameters of the desired (true) function. It can stuck in a local optimum. The learning algorithm may find different functional form that is different than the intended function due to overfitting.  Even if neural network rarely converges and always stuck in a local minimum, it is still able to reduce the cost significantly and come up with very complex models with high test accuracy. The neural network we used in this post is standard fully connected network. However, there are two other kinds of networks:  Convolutional NN: Where not all nodes are connected. It's best in class for image recognition. Recurrent NN: There is a feedback connections where output of the model is fed back into itself. It's used mainly in sequence modeling.  The fully connected neural network also forgets what happened in previous steps and also doesn't know anything about the output. There are number of hyperparameters that we can tune using cross validation to get the best performance of our network:  Learning rate ($\\alpha$): Determines how big the step for each update of parameters.  Small $\\alpha$ leads to slow convergence and may become computationally very expensive. Large $\\alpha$ may lead to overshooting where our learning algorithm may never converge.  Number of hidden layers (depth): The more hidden layers the better, but comes at a cost computationally. Number of units per hidden layer (width): Research proven that huge number of hidden units per layer doesn't add to the improvement of the network. Activation function: Which function to use on hidden layers differs among applications and domains. It's a trial and error process to try different functions and see which one works best. Number of iterations.  Standardize data would help activation units have similar range of values and avoid gradients to go out of control.

The change can be visible such as location of a button on the homepage or invisible such as the ranking/recommendation algorithms and backend infrastructure.\nWeb/Mobile developers and business stakeholders always face the following dilemma: Should we try out all ideas and explore all options continuously? Or should we exploit the best available option and stick to it? The answer is, as in most cases, will be a trade-off between the two extremes. If we explore all the time, we'll collect a lot of data and waste resources in testing inferior ideas and missing sales (e-commerce case). However, if we only exploit the available option and never try new ideas, we would be left behind and loose in the long-term with ever-changing markets.\nIn this series, we'll explore solutions offered by Multi-armed Bandit Algorithms that have two main advantages over traditional A/B testing:\n Smoothly decrease exploration over time instead of sudden jumps. Focus resources on better options and not keep evaluating inferior options during the life of the experiment.  What is Bandit Algorithms? Bandit Algorithms are algorithms that try to learn a rule of selecting a sequence of options that balance exploring available options and getting enough knowledge about each option and maximize profits by selecting the best option. Note that during the experiment, we only have knowledge about the options we tried. Therefore, every time we select an option that's not the best one, we incur an opportunity cost of not selecting the best option; however, we also gain a new knowledge (feedback) about the selected option. In other words, we need to have enough feedback about each option to learn the best option. As a result, the best strategy would be to explore more at the beginning of the experiment until we know the best option and then start exploiting that option.\nepsilon-Greedy Algorithm\nIn this notebook, we'll cover epsilon-Greedy Algorithm. Greedy Algorithm can be defined as the algorithm that picks the best currently available option without taking into consideration the long-term effect of that decision, which may happen to be a suboptimal decision. Given that, we can define epsilon-Greedy Algorithm as a Greedy Algorithm that adds some randomness when deciding between options: Instead of picking always the best available option, randomly explore other options with a probability = 𝜖 or pick the best option with a probability = 1 - 𝜖. Therefore, we can add randomness to the algorithm by increasing 𝜖, which will make the algorithm explores other options more frequently. Additionally, 𝜖 is a hyper-parameter that needs to be tuned based on the experiment, i.e. there is no value that works best on all experiments. Let's explore how the algorithm works assuming we have two options: A and B (we can think of them as Control and Treatment groups). For each new user:\n Assume we have a coin that has a probability of coming heads = 𝜖 and a probability of coming tails = 1 - 𝜖. Therefore,  If it comes heads, explore randomly the available options (exploration). The probability of selecting any option is 1/2. If it comes tails, select the best option (exploitation).   As a result, the probability of selecting any option randomly if we have N options is 𝜖 1/N; however, the probability of selecting the best option is 1 - 𝜖 (see figure 1).\n  epsilon-Greedy Algorithm.   Let's import the needed packages and implement the algorithm.\n# Import packages import os import sys import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import seaborn as sns # Add module path to system path sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\u0026quot;../\u0026quot;)) from utils import plot_algorithm, compare_algorithms %matplotlib inline plt.style.use(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;) sns.set_context(\u0026quot;notebook\u0026quot;)  class EpsilonGreedy: def __init__(self, epsilon, counts=None, values=None): self.epsilon = epsilon self.counts = counts self.values = values def initialize(self, n_arms): self.counts = np.zeros(n_arms, dtype=int) self.values = np.zeros(n_arms, dtype=float) def select_arm(self): z = np.random.random() if z \u0026gt; self.epsilon: # Pick the best arm return np.argmax(self.values) # Randomly pick any arm with prob 1 / len(self.counts) return np.random.randint(0, len(self.values)) def update(self, chosen_arm, reward): # Increment chosen arm's count by one self.counts[chosen_arm] += 1 n = self.counts[chosen_arm] # Recompute the estimated value of chosen arm using new reward value = self.values[chosen_arm] new_value = value * ((n - 1) / n) + reward / n self.values[chosen_arm] = new_value  Few things to note from the above implementation:\n Initialization of values (rewards) affect the long term performance of the algorithm. The larger the sample size (N), the less influential the rewards from the recent options since we are using the average of each option in the values array. Values array will store the estimated values (average) of each option. Counts is just an internal counter that keeps track of the number of times we selected each option.  Monte Carlo Simulations\nIn order to evaluate the algorithm, we will use Monte Carlo simulations. We'll use 5000 simulations to overcome the randomness generated from the random number generator. Also, we'll use Bernoulli distribution to get the reward from each option on each run. For each simulation:\n Initialize the algorithm with no prior knowledge. Loop over the time horizon:  Select the option. Draw the reward for the selected option using Bernoulli distribution and the probability defined. Update the counts and estimated values of selected arm.   We'll define the % of reward (probability) of each option and test the performance of the algorithm using three different metrics:\n Probability of selecting the best option. Average rewards. This metric is a better approximation if the options are similar. Cumulative rewards. The previous two metrics are not fair metrics for algorithms with large epsilon where they sacrifice by exploring more options; however, cumulative rewards is what we should care about.  Moreover, we'll evaluate the algorithm using 5 different values of 𝜖: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5. Since in the literature they use arm instead of option for historical reasons, we'll be using arm and option interchangeably.\nclass BernoulliArm: def __init__(self, p): self.p = p def draw(self): z = np.random.random() if z \u0026gt; self.p: return 0.0 return 1.0 def test_algorithm(algo, arms, num_simulations, horizon): # Initialize rewards and chosen_arms with zero 2d arrays chosen_arms = np.zeros((num_simulations, horizon)) rewards = np.zeros((num_simulations, horizon)) # Loop over all simulations for sim in range(num_simulations): # Re-initialize algorithm's counts and values arrays algo.initialize(len(arms)) # Loop over all time horizon for t in range(horizon): # Select arm chosen_arm = algo.select_arm() chosen_arms[sim, t] = chosen_arm # Draw from Bernoulli distribution to get rewards reward = arms[chosen_arm].draw() rewards[sim, t] = reward # Update the algorithms' count and estimated values algo.update(chosen_arm, reward) # Average rewards across all sims and compute cumulative rewards average_rewards = np.mean(rewards, axis=0) cumulative_rewards = np.cumsum(average_rewards) return chosen_arms, average_rewards, cumulative_rewards  np.random.seed(1) # Average reward by arm means = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.9] n_arms = len(means) # Shuffle the arms np.random.shuffle(means) # Each arm will follow and Bernoulli distribution arms = list(map(lambda mu: BernoulliArm(mu), means)) # Get the index of the best arm to test if algorithm will be able to learn that best_arm_index = np.argmax(means) # Define epsilon value to check the performance of the algorithm using each one epsilon = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] # Plot the epsilon-Greedy algorithm plot_algorithm(alg_name=\u0026quot;epsilon-Greedy\u0026quot;, arms=arms, best_arm_index=best_arm_index, hyper_params=epsilon, num_simulations=5000, horizon=500, label=\u0026quot;eps\u0026quot;)    epsilon-Greedy Algorithm: Vey Different Options.   Few thing to note from the above graphs:\n Regardless of the epsilon values, all algorithms learned the best option. The algorithm picks options randomly; therefore, it's not guaranteed to always pick the best option even if it found that option. That's the main reason why none of the algorithms achieved a probability = 1 of selecting the best option or average rewards = % rewards of the best option even after they learned the best option. As 𝜖 increases --\u0026gt; increase the exploration --\u0026gt; increases the chance of picking options randomly instead of the best option. Algorithms with higher epsilon learn quicker but don't use that knowledge in exploiting the best option. Using accuracy in picking the best option and average rewards metrics, the algorithm 𝜖 = 0.1 outperforms the rest; however, cumulative rewards metric shows that it takes that algorithm long time to outperform the algorithm with 𝜖 = 0.2. Depends on time planned to run the experiment, different values of epsilons may be more optimal. For example, 𝜖 = 0.2 is the best value for almost anything at or below 400.  Let's run the experiment again to see how would the algorithm behave under the following settings:\n Only two options. 50 options. 5 option that are very similar.  np.random.seed(1) # Average reward by arm means = [0.1, 0.9] n_arms = len(means) # Shuffle the arms np.random.shuffle(means) # Each arm will follow and Bernoulli distribution arms = list(map(lambda mu: BernoulliArm(mu), means)) # Get the index of the best arm to test if algorithm will be able to learn that best_arm_index = np.argmax(means) # Define epsilon value to check the performance of the algorithm using each one epsilon = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] # Plot the epsilon-Greedy algorithm plot_algorithm(alg_name=\u0026quot;epsilon-Greedy\u0026quot;, arms=arms, best_arm_index=best_arm_index, hyper_params=epsilon, num_simulations=5000, horizon=500, label=\u0026quot;eps\u0026quot;)    epsilon-Greedy Algorithm: Two Options.   np.random.seed(1) # Average reward by arm means = [i for i in np.random.random(50)] n_arms = len(means) # Shuffle the arms np.random.shuffle(means) # Each arm will follow and Bernoulli distribution arms = list(map(lambda mu: BernoulliArm(mu), means)) # Get the index of the best arm to test if algorithm will be able to learn that best_arm_index = np.argmax(means) # Define epsilon value to check the performance of the algorithm using each one epsilon = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] # Plot the epsilon-Greedy algorithm plot_algorithm(alg_name=\u0026quot;epsilon-Greedy\u0026quot;, arms=arms, best_arm_index=best_arm_index, hyper_params=epsilon, num_simulations=5000, horizon=250, label=\u0026quot;eps\u0026quot;)    epsilon-Greedy Algorithm: Large Number of Options.   np.random.seed(1) # Average reward by arm means = [0.2, 0.18, 0.22, 0.19, 0.21] n_arms = len(means) # Shuffle the arms np.random.shuffle(means) # Each arm will follow and Bernoulli distribution arms = list(map(lambda mu: BernoulliArm(mu), means)) # Get the index of the best arm to test if algorithm will be able to learn that best_arm_index = np.argmax(means) # Define epsilon value to check the performance of the algorithm using each one epsilon = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] # Plot the epsilon-Greedy algorithm plot_algorithm(alg_name=\u0026quot;epsilon-Greedy\u0026quot;, arms=arms, best_arm_index=best_arm_index, hyper_params=epsilon, num_simulations=5000, horizon=500, label=\u0026quot;eps\u0026quot;)    epsilon-Greedy Algorithm: Very Similar Options.    When we had lower number of options, all algorithms were faster at learning the best option which can be seen by the steepness of all curves of the first two graphs when time \u0026lt; 100. As a result, all algorithms had higher cumulative rewards than when we had 5 options. Having large number of options made it hard on all algorithms to learn the best option and may need a lot more time to figure it out. Lastly, when options are very similar (in terms of rewards), the probability of selecting the best option by all algorithms decreases over time. Let's take the algorithm with 𝜖 = 0.1 and see why is this the case. After some investigation, the algorithm was struggling in differentiating between the best option and the second best option since the difference between the % rewards is 1%. Therefore, the probability of selecting the best arm was around 50%.  Annealing epsilon-Greedy Algorithm\nEpsilon value plays a major role in the performance of epsilon-Greedy algorithm and has to be tuned to the best of our knowledge in terms of the expectations of the estimated rewards of each option. Nonetheless, this estimation suffers from high uncertainty since most of the times either we have no clue what might work or the results would be against our intuition as user experience research has shown in multiple studies. Therefore, isn't it nice if we can avoid setting up the epsilon values and make the algorithm parameter-free? That's what Annealing epsilon-Greedy Algorithm does. We specify the rule of decaying epsilon with time and let the algorithm runs with no hyper-parameter configurations. The rule of we will use here is: 𝜖 = 1/log(time + 0.0000001). As we can see, at the beginning of the experiment, 𝜖 would be close to Inf and that means a lot of exploration; however, as time goes, 𝜖 start approaching zero and the algorithm would exploit more and more by selecting the best option.\nWe will evaluate the Annealed version using the same settings as before and compare it to standard version.\nclass AnnealingEpsilonGreedy(EpsilonGreedy): def __init__(self, counts=None, values=None): self.counts = counts self.values = values def select_arm(self): # Epsilon decay schedule t = np.sum(self.counts) + 1 epsilon = 1 / np.log(t + 0.0000001) z = np.random.random() if z \u0026gt; epsilon: # Pick the best arm return np.argmax(self.values) # Randomly pick any arm with prob 1 / len(self.counts) return np.random.randint(0, len(self.values))  np.random.seed(1) # Average reward by arm means = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.9] n_arms = len(means) # Shuffle the arms np.random.shuffle(means) # Each arm will follow and Bernoulli distribution arms = list(map(lambda mu: BernoulliArm(mu), means)) # Get the index of the best arm to test if algorithm will be able to learn that best_arm_index = np.argmax(means) # Plot the epsilon-Greedy algorithm plot_algorithm(alg_name=\u0026quot;Annealing epsilon-Greedy\u0026quot;, arms=arms, best_arm_index=best_arm_index, num_simulations=5000, horizon=500)    Annealing epsilon-Greedy Algorithm.   Even though the accuracy of selecting the best option and the average rewards of the annealing epsilon-Greedy Algorithm is lower than the standard version, it has higher cumulative rewards. Also, since the real world is uncertain and we may not have any clue about the designed options, it may be preferred to use the annealing version under some scenarios.\nConclusion\nepsilon-Greedy Algorithm works by going back and forth between exploration with probability = 𝜖 and exploitation with probability 1 - 𝜖. Below are some takeaways:\n Setting the value of epsilon:  If we set 𝜖 = 1, we would only explore the available options with a probability = 1/N of selecting any option. This will enable us to explore a lot of ideas at the expense of wasting resources by evaluating inferior options. If we set 𝜖 = 0, we would exploit the best option and never explore any new idea. This strategy would leave up behind our competitors given that the markets are so volatile.  Exploration should be high at the beginning of the experiment to gain the knowledge about all the available options. It should decrease as a function of time where at some point after having enough data about all options, the algorithm should focus on exploiting the best option. All algorithms with different epsilon values learned the best option; however, they differ by the level of randomness of each algorithm in keep randomly exploring available options. To get the best results of any Bandit algorithm, we should have a lot of data, which means to run the experiment longer in most cases. For experiments that run for short period of time, traditional A/B testing may be better. Initialization of estimated rewards can affect the long-term performance of the algorithm. As a result, we may need to use previous experience and intuition to guide our initial values.  Note: Source code that created this post can be found here.

The answer to the first question determines the interest rate the borrower would have. Interest rate measures among other things (such as time value of money) the riskness of the borrower, i.e. the riskier the borrower, the higher the interest rate. With interest rate in mind, we can then determine if the borrower is eligible for the loan.\nInvestors (lenders) provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. That means the lender only makes profit (interest) if the borrower pays off the loan. However, if he/she doesn't repay the loan, then the lender loses money.\nWe'll be using publicly available data from LendingClub.com. The data covers the 9,578 loans funded by the platform between May 2007 and February 2010. The interest rate is provided to us for each borrower. Therefore, so we'll address the second question indirectly by trying to predict if the borrower will repay the loan by its mature date or not. Through this excerise we'll illustrate three modeling concepts:\n What to do with missing values. Techniques used with imbalanced classification problems. Illustrate how to build an ensemble model using two methods: blending and stacking, which most likely gives us a boost in performance.  Below is a short description of each feature in the data set:\n credit_policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise. purpose: The purpose of the loan such as: credit_card, debt_consolidation, etc. int_rate: The interest rate of the loan (proportion). installment: The monthly installments (\\$) owed by the borrower if the loan is funded. log_annual_inc: The natural log of the annual income of the borrower. dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower. fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower. days_with_cr_line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line. revol_bal: The borrower's revolving balance. revol_util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate. inq_last_6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months. delinq_2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years. pub_rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records. not_fully_paid: indicates whether the loan was not paid back in full (the borrower either defaulted or the borrower was deemed unlikely to pay it back).

It looks like we have only one categorical feature (\u0026quot;purpose\u0026quot;). Also, six features have missing values (no missing values in labels). Moreover, the data set is pretty imbalanced as expected where positive examples (\u0026quot;not paid fully\u0026quot;) are only 19%. We'll explain in the next section how to handle all of them after giving an overview of ensemble methods.\nModeling\nEnsemble methods can be defined as combining several different models (base learners) into final model (meta learner) to reduce the generalization error. It relies on the assumption that each model would look at a different aspect of the data which yield to capturing part of the truth. Combining good performing models the were trained independently will capture more of the truth than a single model. Therefore, this would result in more accurate predictions and lower generalization errors.\n Almost always ensemble model performance gets improved as we add more models. Try to combine models that are as much different as possible. This will reduce the correlation between the models that will improve the performance of the ensemble model that will lead to significantly outperform the best model. In the worst case where all models are perfectly correlated, the ensemble would have the same performance as the best model and sometimes even lower if some models are very bad. As a result, pick models that are as good as possible.  Diﬀerent ensemble methods construct the ensemble of models in diﬀerent ways. Below are the most common methods:\n Blending: Averaging the predictions of all models. Bagging: Build different models on different datasets and then take the majority vote from all the models. Given the original dataset, we sample with replacement to get the same size of the original dataset. Therefore, each dataset will include, on average, 2/3 of the original data and the rest 1/3 will be duplicates. Since each model will be built on a different dataset, it can be seen as a different model. Random Forest improves on default bagging trees by reducing the likelihood of strong features to picked on every split. In other words, it reduces the number of features available at each split from $n$ features to, for example, $n/2$ or $log(n)$ features. This will reduce correlation --\u0026gt; reduce variance. Boosting: Build models sequentially. That means each model learns from the residuals of the previous model. The output will be all output of each single model weighted by the learning rate ($\\lambda$). It reduces the bias resulted from bagging by learning sequentially from residuals of previous trees (models). Stacking: Build k models called base learners. Then fit a model to the output of the base learners to predict the final output.  Since we'll be using Random Fores (bagging) and Gradient Boosting (boosting) classifiers as base learners in the ensemble model, we'll illustrate only averaging and stacking ensemble methods. Therefore, modeling parts would be consisted of three parts:\n Strategies to deal with missing values. Strategies to deal with imbalanced datasets. Build ensemble models.  Before going further, the following data preprocessing steps will be applicable to all models:\n Create dummy variables from the feature \u0026quot;purpose\u0026quot; since its nominal (not ordinal) categorical variable. It's also a good practice to drop the first one to avoid linear dependency between the resulted features since some algorithms may struggle with this issue. Split the data into training set (70%), and test set (30%). Training set will be used to fit the model, and test set will be to evaluate the best model to get an estimation of generalization error. Instead of having validation set to tune hyperparameters and evaluate different models, we'll use 10-folds cross validation because it's more reliable estimate of generalization error. Standardize the data. We'll be using RobustScaler so that the standarization will be less influenced by the outliers, i.e. more robust. It centers the data around the median and scale it using interquartile range (IQR). This step will be included in the pipelines for each model as a transformer so we will not do it separately.  # Create dummy variables from the feature purpose df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=[\u0026quot;purpose\u0026quot;], drop_first=True) df.head()    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th { text-align: right; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: left; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; }    credit_policy int_rate installment log_annual_inc dti fico days_with_cr_line revol_bal revol_util inq_last_6mths delinq_2yrs pub_rec not_fully_paid purpose_credit_card purpose_debt_consolidation purpose_educational purpose_home_improvement purpose_major_purchase purpose_small_business     0 1 0.1189 829.10 11.350407 19.48 737 5639.958333 28854 52.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0   1 1 0.1071 228.22 11.082143 14.29 707 2760.000000 33623 76.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0   2 1 0.1357 366.86 10.373491 11.63 682 4710.000000 3511 25.6 1.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0   3 1 0.1008 162.34 11.350407 8.10 712 2699.958333 33667 73.2 1.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0   4 1 0.1426 102.92 11.299732 14.97 667 4066.000000 4740 39.5 0.0 1.0 0.0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0     Strategies to deal with missing values\nAlmost always real world data sets have missing values. This can be due, for example, users didn't fill some part of the forms or some transformations happened while collecting and cleaning the data before they send it to you. Sometimes missing values are informative and weren't generated randomly. Therefore, it's a good practice to add binary features to check if there is missing values in each row for each feature that has missing values. In our case, six features have missing values so we would add six binary features one for each feature. For example, \u0026quot;log_annual_inc\u0026quot; feature has missing values, so we would add a feature \u0026quot;is_log_annual_inc_missing\u0026quot; that takes the values $\\in {0, 1}$. Good thing is that the missing values are in the predictors only and not the labels. Below are some of the most common strategies for dealing with missing values:\n Simply delete all examples that have any missing values. This is usually done if the missing values are very small compared to the size of the data set and the missing values were random. In other words, the added binary features did not improve the model. One disadvantage for this strategy is that the model will throw an error when test data has missing values at prediction. Impute the missing values using the mean of each feature separately. Impute the missing values using the median of each feature separately. Use Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). The main disadvantage of MICE is that we can't use it as a transformer in sklearn pipelines and it requires to use the full data set when imputing the missing values. This means that there will be a risk of data leakage since we're using both training and test sets to impute the missing values. The following steps explain how MICE works:  First step: Impute the missing values using the mean of each feature separately. Second step: For each feature that has missing values, we take all other features as predictors (including the ones that had missing values) and try to predict the values for this feature using linear regression for example. The predicted values will replace the old values for that feature. We do this for all features that have missing values, i.e. each feature will be used once as a target variable to predict its values and the rest of the time as a predictor to predict other features' values. Therefore, one complete cycle (iteration) will be done once we run the model $k$ times to predict the $k$ features that have missing values. For our data set, each iteration will run the linear regression 6 times to predict the 6 features. Third step: Repeat step 2 until there is not much of change between predictions.  Impute the missing values using K-Nearest Neighbors. We compute distance between all examples (excluding missing values) in the data set and take the average of k-nearest neighbors of each missing value. There's no implementation for it yet in sklearn and it's pretty inefficient to compute it since we'll have to go through all examples to calculate distances. Therefore, we'll skip this strategy in this post.  To evaluate each strategy, we'll use Random Forest classifier with hyperparameters' values guided by Data-driven Advice for Applying Machine Learning to Bioinformatics Problems as a starting point.\nLet's first create binary features for missing values and then prepare the data for each strategy discussed above. Next, we'll compute the 10-folds cross validation AUC score for all the models using training data.\n# Create binary features to check if the example is has missing values for all features that have missing values for feature in df.columns: if np.any(np.isnan(df[feature])): df[\u0026quot;is_\u0026quot; + feature + \u0026quot;_missing\u0026quot;] = np.isnan(df[feature]) * 1 df.head()    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th { text-align: right; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: left; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; }    credit_policy int_rate installment log_annual_inc dti fico days_with_cr_line revol_bal revol_util inq_last_6mths ... purpose_educational purpose_home_improvement purpose_major_purchase purpose_small_business is_log_annual_inc_missing is_days_with_cr_line_missing is_revol_util_missing is_inq_last_6mths_missing is_delinq_2yrs_missing is_pub_rec_missing     0 1 0.1189 829.10 11.350407 19.48 737 5639.958333 28854 52.1 0.0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   1 1 0.1071 228.22 11.082143 14.29 707 2760.000000 33623 76.7 0.0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   2 1 0.1357 366.86 10.373491 11.63 682 4710.000000 3511 25.6 1.0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   3 1 0.1008 162.34 11.350407 8.10 712 2699.958333 33667 73.2 1.0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   4 1 0.1426 102.92 11.299732 14.97 667 4066.000000 4740 39.5 0.0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     # Original Data X = df.loc[:, df.columns != \u0026quot;not_fully_paid\u0026quot;].values y = df.loc[:, df.columns == \u0026quot;not_fully_paid\u0026quot;].values.flatten() X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=True, random_state=123, stratify=y) print(f\u0026quot;Original data shapes: {X_train.shape, X_test.shape}\u0026quot;) # Drop NA and remove binary columns train_indices_na = np.max(np.isnan(X_train), axis=1) test_indices_na = np.max(np.isnan(X_test), axis=1) X_train_dropna, y_train_dropna = X_train[~train_indices_na, :][:, :-6], y_train[~train_indices_na] X_test_dropna, y_test_dropna = X_test[~test_indices_na, :][:, :-6], y_test[~test_indices_na] print(f\u0026quot;After dropping NAs: {X_train_dropna.shape, X_test_dropna.shape}\u0026quot;) # MICE data mice = fancyimpute.MICE(verbose=0) X_mice = mice.complete(X) X_train_mice, X_test_mice, y_train_mice, y_test_mice = train_test_split( X_mice, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=True, random_state=123, stratify=y) print(f\u0026quot;MICE data shapes: {X_train_mice.shape, X_test_mice.shape}\u0026quot;)  Original data shapes: ((7662, 24), (1916, 24)) After dropping NAs: ((7611, 18), (1905, 18)) MICE data shapes: ((7662, 24), (1916, 24))  # Build random forest classifier rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_features=0.25, criterion=\u0026quot;entropy\u0026quot;, class_weight=\u0026quot;balanced\u0026quot;) # Build base line model -- Drop NA's pip_baseline = make_pipeline(RobustScaler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_baseline, X_train_dropna, y_train_dropna, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;Baseline model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model with mean imputation pip_impute_mean = make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_impute_mean, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;Mean imputation model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model with median imputation pip_impute_median = make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;median\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_impute_median, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;Median imputation model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model using MICE imputation pip_impute_mice = make_pipeline(RobustScaler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_impute_mice, X_train_mice, y_train_mice, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;MICE imputation model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;)  \u001bBaseline model's average AUC: 0.651 \u001bMean imputation model's average AUC: 0.651 \u001bMedian imputation model's average AUC: 0.651 \u001bMICE imputation model's average AUC: 0.656  Let's plot the feature importances to check if the added binary features added anything to the model.\n# fit RF to plot feature importances rf_clf.fit(RobustScaler().fit_transform(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;median\u0026quot;).fit_transform(X_train)), y_train) # Plot features importance importances = rf_clf.feature_importances_ indices = np.argsort(rf_clf.feature_importances_)[::-1] plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6)) plt.bar(range(1, 25), importances[indices], align=\u0026quot;center\u0026quot;) plt.xticks(range(1, 25), df.columns[df.columns != \u0026quot;not_fully_paid\u0026quot;][indices], rotation=90) plt.title(\u0026quot;Feature Importance\u0026quot;, {\u0026quot;fontsize\u0026quot;: 16});    Random Forest feature importance.   Guided by the 10-fold cross validation AUC scores, it looks like all strategies have comparable results and missing values were generated randomly. Also, the added six binary features showed no importance when plotting feature importances from Random Forest classifier. Therefore, it's safe to drop those features and use Median Imputation method as a transformer later on in the pipeline.\n# Drop generated binary features X_train = X_train[:, :-6] X_test = X_test[:, :-6]  Strategies to deal with imbalanced datasets\nClassification problems in most real world applications have imbalanced data sets. In other words, the positive examples (minority class) are a lot less than negative examples (majority class). We can see that in spam detection, ads click, loan approvals, etc. In our example, the positive examples (people who haven't fully paid) were only 19% from the total examples. Therefore, accuracy is no longer a good measure of performance for different models because if we simply predict all examples to belong to the negative class, we achieve 81% accuracy. Better metrics for imbalanced data sets are AUC (area under the ROC curve) and f1-score. However, that's not enough because class imbalance influences a learning algorithm during training by making the decision rule biased towards the majority class by implicitly learns a model that optimizes the predictions based on the majority class in the dataset. As a result, we'll explore different methods to overcome class imbalance problem.\n Under-Sample: Under-sample the majority class with or w/o replacement by making the number of positive and negative examples equal. One of the drawbacks of under-sampling is that it ignores a good portion of training data that has valuable information. In our example, it would loose around 6500 examples. However, it's very fast to train. Over-Sample: Over-sample the minority class with or w/o replacement by making the number of positive and negative examples equal. We'll add around 6500 samples from the training data set with this strategy. It's a lot more computationally expensive than under-sampling. Also, it's more prune to overfitting due to repeated examples. EasyEnsemble: Sample several subsets from the majority class, build a classifier on top of each sampled data, and combine the output of all classifiers. More details can be found here. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE): It over-samples the minority class but using synthesized examples. It operates on feature space not the data space. Here how it works:  Compute the k-nearest neighbors for all minority samples. Randomly choose number between 1-k. For each feature:  Compute the difference between minority sample and its randomly chosen neighbor (from previous step). Multiply the difference by random number between 0 and 1. Add the obtained feature to the synthesized sample attributes.  Repeat the above until we get the number of synthesized samples needed. More information can be found here.   There are other methods such as EditedNearestNeighbors and CondensedNearestNeighbors that we will not cover in this post and are rarely used in practice.\nIn most applications, misclassifying the minority class (false negative) is a lot more expensive than misclassifying the majority class (false positive). In the context of lending, loosing money by lending to a risky borrower who is more likely to not fully pay the loan back is a lot more costly than missing the opportunity of lending to trust-worthy borrower (less risky). As a result, we can use class_weight that changes the weight of misclassifying positive example in the loss function. Also, we can use different cut-offs assign examples to classes. By default, 0.5 is the cut-off; however, we see more often in applications such as lending that the cut-off is less than 0.5. Note that changing the cut-off from the default 0.5 reduce the overall accuracy but may improve the accuracy of predicting positive/negative examples.\nWe'll evaluate all the above methods plus the original model without resampling as a baseline model using the same Random Forest classifier we used in the missing values section.\n# Build random forest classifier (same config) rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_features=0.25, criterion=\u0026quot;entropy\u0026quot;, class_weight=\u0026quot;balanced\u0026quot;) # Build model with no sampling pip_orig = make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_orig, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;Original model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model with undersampling pip_undersample = imb_make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), RandomUnderSampler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_undersample, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;Under-sampled model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model with oversampling pip_oversample = imb_make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), RandomOverSampler(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_oversample, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;Over-sampled model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model with EasyEnsemble resampled_rf = BalancedBaggingClassifier(base_estimator=rf_clf, n_estimators=10, random_state=123) pip_resampled = make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), resampled_rf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_resampled, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;EasyEnsemble model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;) # Build model with SMOTE pip_smote = imb_make_pipeline(Imputer(strategy=\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), RobustScaler(), SMOTE(), rf_clf) scores = cross_val_score(pip_smote, X_train, y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;roc_auc\u0026quot;, cv=10) print(f\u0026quot;SMOTE model's average AUC: {scores.mean():.3f}\u0026quot;)  \u001bOriginal model's average AUC: 0.652 \u001bUnder-sampled model's average AUC: 0.656 \u001bOver-sampled model's average AUC: 0.651 \u001bEasyEnsemble model's average AUC: 0.665 \u001bSMOTE model's average AUC: 0.641  EasyEnsemble method has the highest 10-folds CV with average AUC = 0.665.\nBuild Ensemble models\nWe'll build ensemble models using three different models as base learners:\n Gradient Boosting Support Vector Classifier Random Forest  The ensemble models will be built using two different methods:\n Blending (average) ensemble model. Fits the base learners to the training data and then, at test time, average the predictions generated by all the base learners.  Use VotingClassifier from sklearn that: Fits all the base learners on the training data At test time, use all base learners to predict test data and then take the average of all predictions.  Stacked ensemble model: Fits the base learners to the training data. Next, use those trained base learners to generate predictions (meta-features) used by the meta-learner (assuming we have only one layer of base learners). There are few different ways of training stacked ensemble model:  Fitting the base learners to all training data and then generate predictions using the same training data it was used to fit those learners. This method is more prune to overfitting because the meta learner will give more weights to the base learner who memorized the training data better, i.e. meta-learner won't generate well and would overfit. Split the training data into 2 to 3 different parts that will be used for training, validation, and generate predictions. It's a suboptimal method because held out sets usually have higher variance and different splits give different results as well as learning algorithms would have fewer data to train. Use k-folds cross validation where we split the data into k-folds. We fit the base learners to the (k - 1) folds and use the fitted models to generate predictions of the held out fold. We repeat the process until we generate the predictions for all the k-folds. When done, refit the base learners to the full training data. This method is more reliable and will give models that memorize the data less weight. Therefore, it generalizes better on future data.   We'll use logistic regression as the meta-learner for the stacked model. Note that we can use k-folds cross validation to validate and tune the hyperparameters of the meta learner. We will not tune the hyperparameters of any of the base learners or the meta-learner; however, we will use some of the values recommended by the Pennsylvania Benchmarking Paper. Additionally, we won't use EasyEnsemble in training because, after some experimentation, it didn't improve the AUC of the ensemble model more than 2% on average and it was computationally very expensive. In practice, we sometimes are willing to give up small improvements if the model would become a lot more complex computationally. Therefore, we will use RandomUnderSampler. Also, we'll impute the missing values and standardize the data beforehand so that it would shorten the code of the ensemble models and allows use to avoid using Pipeline. Additionally, we will plot ROC and PR curves using test data and evaluate the performance of all models.\n# Impute the missing data using features means imp = Imputer() imp.fit(X_train) X_train = imp.transform(X_train) X_test = imp.transform(X_test) # Standardize the data std = RobustScaler() std.fit(X_train) X_train = std.transform(X_train) X_test = std.transform(X_test) # Implement RandomUnderSampler random_undersampler = RandomUnderSampler() X_res, y_res = random_undersampler.fit_sample(X_train, y_train) # Shuffle the data perms = np.random.permutation(X_res.shape[0]) X_res = X_res[perms] y_res = y_res[perms] X_res.shape, y_res.shape  ((2452, 18), (2452,))  # Define base learners xgb_clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective=\u0026quot;binary:logistic\u0026quot;, learning_rate=0.03, n_estimators=500, max_depth=1, subsample=0.4, random_state=123) svm_clf = SVC(gamma=0.1, C=0.01, kernel=\u0026quot;poly\u0026quot;, degree=3, coef0=10.0, probability=True) rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=300, max_features=\u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;, criterion=\u0026quot;gini\u0026quot;, min_samples_leaf=5, class_weight=\u0026quot;balanced\u0026quot;) # Define meta-learner logreg_clf = LogisticRegression(penalty=\u0026quot;l2\u0026quot;, C=100, fit_intercept=True) # Fitting voting clf --\u0026gt; average ensemble voting_clf = VotingClassifier([(\u0026quot;xgb\u0026quot;, xgb_clf), (\u0026quot;svm\u0026quot;, svm_clf), (\u0026quot;rf\u0026quot;, rf_clf)], voting=\u0026quot;soft\u0026quot;, flatten_transform=True) voting_clf.fit(X_res, y_res) xgb_model, svm_model, rf_model = voting_clf.estimators_ models = {\u0026quot;xgb\u0026quot;: xgb_model, \u0026quot;svm\u0026quot;: svm_model, \u0026quot;rf\u0026quot;: rf_model, \u0026quot;avg_ensemble\u0026quot;: voting_clf} # Build first stack of base learners first_stack = make_pipeline(voting_clf, FunctionTransformer(lambda X: X[:, 1::2])) # Use CV to generate meta-features meta_features = cross_val_predict(first_stack, X_res, y_res, cv=10, method=\u0026quot;transform\u0026quot;) # Refit the first stack on the full training set first_stack.fit(X_res, y_res) # Fit the meta learner second_stack = logreg_clf.fit(meta_features, y_res) # Plot ROC and PR curves using all models and test data fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6)) for name, model in models.items(): model_probs = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1:] model_auc_score = roc_auc_score(y_test, model_probs) fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, model_probs) precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, model_probs) axes[0].plot(fpr, tpr, label=f\u0026quot;{name}, auc = {model_auc_score:.3f}\u0026quot;) axes[1].plot(recall, precision, label=f\u0026quot;{name}\u0026quot;) stacked_probs = second_stack.predict_proba(first_stack.transform(X_test))[:, 1:] stacked_auc_score = roc_auc_score(y_test, stacked_probs) fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, stacked_probs) precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, stacked_probs) axes[0].plot(fpr, tpr, label=f\u0026quot;stacked_ensemble, auc = {stacked_auc_score:.3f}\u0026quot;) axes[1].plot(recall, precision, label=\u0026quot;stacked_ensembe\u0026quot;) axes[0].legend(loc=\u0026quot;lower right\u0026quot;) axes[0].set_xlabel(\u0026quot;FPR\u0026quot;) axes[0].set_ylabel(\u0026quot;TPR\u0026quot;) axes[0].set_title(\u0026quot;ROC curve\u0026quot;) axes[1].legend() axes[1].set_xlabel(\u0026quot;recall\u0026quot;) axes[1].set_ylabel(\u0026quot;precision\u0026quot;) axes[1].set_title(\u0026quot;PR curve\u0026quot;) plt.tight_layout()    ROC and PR curves.   As we can see from the chart above, stacked ensemble model didn't improve the performance. One of the major reasons are that the base learners are considerably highly correlated especially Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (see the correlation matrix below).\n# Plot the correlation between base learners probs_df = pd.DataFrame(meta_features, columns=[\u0026quot;xgb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;svm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rf\u0026quot;]) corrmat(probs_df.corr(), inflate=True);    Correlation matrix.   In addition, with classification problems where False Negatives are a lot more expensive than False Positives, we may want to have a model with a high precision rather than high recall, i.e. the probability of the model to identify positive examples from randomly selected examples.

Let's finally check the partial dependence plots to see what are the most important features and their relationships with whether the borrower will most likely pay the loan in full before mature data. we will plot only the top 8 features to make it easier to read. Note that the partial plots are based on Gradient Boosting model.\n# Plot partial dependence plots gbrt = GradientBoostingClassifier(loss=\u0026quot;deviance\u0026quot;, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, random_state=123) gbrt.fit(X_res, y_res) fig, axes = plot_partial_dependence(gbrt, X_res, np.argsort(gbrt.feature_importances_)[::-1][:8], n_cols=4, feature_names=df.columns[:-6], figsize=(14, 8)) plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9) plt.suptitle(\u0026quot;Partial dependence plots of borrower not fully paid\\n\u0026quot; \u0026quot;the loan based on top most influential features\u0026quot;) for ax in axes: ax.set_xticks(())    Partial dependence plots.   As we might expected, borrowers with lower annual income and less FICO scores are less likely to pay the loan fully; however, borrowers with lower interest rates (riskier) and smaller installments are more likely to pay the loan fully.\nConclusion\nMost classification problems in the real world are imbalanced. Also, almost always data sets have missing values. In this post, we covered strategies to deal with both missing values and imbalanced data sets. We also explored different ways of building ensembles in sklearn. Below are some takeaway points:\n There is no definitive guide of which algorithms to use given any situation. What may work on some data sets may not necessarily work on others. Therefore, always evaluate methods using cross validation to get a reliable estimates. Sometimes we may be willing to give up some improvement to the model if that would increase the complexity much more than the percentage change in the improvement to the evaluation metrics. In some classification problems, False Negatives are a lot more expensive than False Positives. Therefore, we can reduce cut-off points to reduce the False Negatives. When building ensemble models, try to use good models that are as different as possible to reduce correlation between the base learners. We could've enhanced our stacked ensemble model by adding Dense Neural Network and some other kind of base learners as well as adding more layers to the stacked model. EasyEnsemble usually performs better than any other resampling methods. Missing values sometimes add more information to the model than we might expect. One way of capturing it is to add binary features for each feature that has missing values to check if each example is missing or not.

The answer to the first question determines the interest rate the borrower would have.

Or how your phone suggests next word when texting? Or even how a Neural Network can generate musical notes? The general way of generating a sequence of text is to train a model to predict the next word/character given all previous words/characters. Such model is called a Statistical Language Model. What is a statistical language model? A statistical language model tries to capture the statistical structure (latent space) of training text it's trained on. Usually Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models family are used to train the model due to the fact that they are very powerful and expressive in which they remember and process past information through their high dimensional hidden state units. The main goal of any language model is to learn the joint probability distribution of sequences of characters/words in a training text, i.e. trying to learn the joint probability function. For example, if we're trying to predict a sequence of $T$ words, we try to get the joint probability $P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_T)$ as big as we can which is equal to the product of all conditional probabilities $\\prod_{t = 1}^T P(w_t/w_{t-1})$ at all time steps (t).\nIn this post, we'll cover the Character-Level Language Model where almost all the concepts hold for any other language models such as word-language models. The main task of the character-level language model is to predict the next character given all previous characters in a sequence of data, i.e. generates text character by character. More formally, given a training sequence $(x^1, ... , x^T)$, the RNN uses the sequence of its output vectors $(o^1, ... , o^T)$ to obtain a sequence of predictive distributions $P(xt/x{t-1}) = softmax(o^t)$.\nLet's illustrate how the character-level language model works using my first name (\u0026quot;imad\u0026quot;) as an example (see figure 1 for all the details of this example).\n We first build a vocabulary dictionary using all the unique letters of the names in the corpus as keys and the index of each letter starting from zero (since Python is a zero-indexed language) in an ascending order. For our example, the vocabulary dictionary would be: {\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;i\u0026quot;: 2, \u0026quot;m\u0026quot;: 3}. Therefore, \u0026quot;imad\u0026quot; would become a list of the following integers: [2, 3, 0, 1]. Convert the input and the output characters to lists of integers using the vocabulary dictionary. In this post, we'll assume that $x^1 = \\vec{0}$ for all examples. Therefore, $y = \u0026quot;imad\u0026quot;$ and $x = \\vec{0}\\ + \u0026quot;ima\u0026quot;$. In other words, $x^{t + 1} = y^t$ which gives us: $y = [2, 3, 0, 1]$ and $x = [\\vec{0}, 2, 3, 0]$. For each character in the input:  Convert the input characters into one-hot vectors. Notice how the first character $x^1 = \\vec{0}$. Compute the hidden state layer. Compute the output layer and then pass it through softmax to get the results as probabilities. Feed the target character at time step (t) as the input character at time step $(t + 1)$. Go back to step A and repeat until we finish all the letters in the name.   The objective is to make the green numbers as big as we can and the red numbers as small as we can in the probability distribution layer. The reason is that the true index should have the highest probability by making it as close as we can to 1. The way to do that is to measure the loss using cross-entropy and then compute the gradients of the loss w.r.t. all parameters to update them in the opposite of the gradient direction. Repeating the process over many times where each time we adjust the parameters based on the gradient direction --\u0026gt; model will be able to correctly predict next characters given all previous ones using all names in the training text. Notice that hidden state $h^4$ has all past information about all characters.\n  Illustrative example of character-level language model using RNN.   Note: To shorten the length of the post, I deleted all the docstrings of python functions and I didn't include some functions that i didn't think are necessary to understand the main concepts. The notebook and the script that created this post can be found here and here.\nTraining The dataset we'll be using has 5,163 names: 4,275 male names, 1,219 female names, and 331 names that can be both female and male names. The RNN architecture we'll be using to train the character-level language model is called many to many where time steps of the input $(T_x)$ = time steps of the output $(T_y)$. In other words, the sequence of the input and output are synced (see figure 2).\n  RNN architecture: many to many.   The character-level language model will be trained on names; which means after we're done with training the model, we'll be able to generate some interesting names :).\nIn this section, we'll go over four main parts:\n Forward propagation. Backpropagation. Sampling. Fitting the model.   Forward Propagation\nWe'll be using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) where each batch consists of only one example. In other words, the RNN model will learn from each example (name) separately, i.e. run both forward and backward passes on each example and update parameters accordingly. Below are all the steps needed for a forward pass:\n Create a vocabulary dictionary using the unique lower case letters.\n Create a character to index dictionary that maps each character to its corresponding index in an ascending order. For example, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; would have index 1 (since python is a zero index language and we'll reserve 0 index to EOS \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) and \u0026quot;z\u0026quot; would have index 26. We will use this dictionary in converting names into lists of integers where each letter will be represented as one-hot vector. Create an index to character dictionary that maps indices to characters. This dictionary will be used to convert the output of the RNN model into characters which will be translated into names.  Initialize parameters: weights will be initialized to small random numbers from standard normal distribution to break symmetry and make sure different hidden units learn different things. On the other hand, biases will be initialized to zeros.\n $W_{hh}$: weight matrix connecting previous hidden state $h^{t - 1}$ to current hidden state $h^t$. $W_{xh}$: weight matrix connecting input $x^t$ to hidden state $h^t$. $b$: hidden state bias vector. $W_{hy}$: weight matrix connecting hidden state $h^t$ to output $o^t$. $c$: output bias vector.  Convert input $x^t$ and output $y^t$ into one-hot vector each. The dimension of the one-hot vector is vocab_size x 1. Everything will be zero except for the index of the letter at (t) would be 1. In our case, $x^t$ would be the same as $y^t$ shifted to the left where $x^1 = \\vec{0}$; however, starting from $t = 2$, $x^{t + 1} = y^{t}$. For example, if we use \u0026quot;imad\u0026quot; as the input, then $y = [3, 4, 1, 2, 0]$ while $x = [\\vec{0}, 3, 4, 1, 2]$. Notice that $x^1 = \\vec{0}$ and not the index 0. Moreover, we're using \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot; as EOS (end of sentence/name) for each name so that the RNN learns \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot; as any other character. This will help the network learn when to to stop generating characters. Therefore, the last target character for all names will be \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot; that represents the end of the name.\n Compute the hidden state using the following formula:\n  \\(h^t = tanh(W_{hh}h^{t - 1} + W_{xh}x^t + b)\\tag{1}\\) Notice that we use hyperbolic tangent $(\\frac{e^x - e{-x}}{ex + e^{-x}})$ as the non-linear function. One of the main advantages of the hyperbolic tangent function is that it resembles the identity function.\n Compute the output layer using the following formula:  \\[o^t = W_{hy}h^{t} + c \\tag{2}\\]\n Pass the output through softmax layer to normalize the output that allows us to express it as a probability, i.e. all output will be between 0 and 1 and sum up to 1. Below is the softmax formula:  \\(\\widehat{y^t} = \\frac{e^{o^t}}{\\sum_ie^{o_i^t}}\\tag{3}\\) The softmax layer has the same dimension as the output layer which is vocab_size x 1. As a result, $y^t[i]$ is the probability of index $i$ being the next character at time step (t).\n As mentioned before, the objective of a character-level language model is to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the training sequence. Therefore, the loss function at time step (t) and the total loss across all time steps are:  \\[\\mathcal{L}^t = -\\sum_{i = 1}^{T_y}y^tlog\\widehat{y^t}\\tag{4}\\]\n\\(\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t = 1}^{T_y}\\mathcal{L}^t(\\widehat{y^t}, y^t)\\tag{5}\\) Since we'll be using SGD, the loss will be noisy and have many oscillations, so it's a good practice to smooth out the loss using exponential weighted average.\n Pass the target character $y^t$ as the next input $x^{t + 1}$ until we finish the sequence.  # Load packages import os import numpy as np os.chdir(\u0026quot;../scripts/\u0026quot;) from character_level_language_model import (initialize_parameters, initialize_rmsprop, softmax, smooth_loss, update_parameters_with_rmsprop) def rnn_forward(x, y, h_prev, parameters): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Implement one Forward pass on one name.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Retrieve parameters Wxh, Whh, b = parameters[\u0026quot;Wxh\u0026quot;], parameters[\u0026quot;Whh\u0026quot;], parameters[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;] Why, c = parameters[\u0026quot;Why\u0026quot;], parameters[\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;] # Initialize inputs, hidden state, output, and probabilities dictionaries xs, hs, os, probs = {}, {}, {}, {} # Initialize x0 to zero vector xs[0] = np.zeros((vocab_size, 1)) # Initialize loss and assigns h_prev to last hidden state in hs loss = 0 hs[-1] = np.copy(h_prev) # Forward pass: loop over all characters of the name for t in range(len(x)): # Convert to one-hot vector if t \u0026gt; 0: xs[t] = np.zeros((vocab_size, 1)) xs[t][x[t]] = 1 # Hidden state hs[t] = np.tanh(np.dot(Wxh, xs[t]) + np.dot(Whh, hs[t - 1]) + b) # Logits os[t] = np.dot(Why, hs[t]) + c # Probs probs[t] = softmax(os[t]) # Loss loss -= np.log(probs[t][y[t], 0]) cache = (xs, hs, probs) return loss, cache   Backpropagation\nWith RNN based models, the gradient-based technique that will be used is called Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). We start at last time step $T$ and backpropagate loss function w.r.t. all parameters across all time steps and sum them up (see figure 4).\n  Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).   In addition, since RNNs are known to have steep cliffs (sudden steep decrease in $\\mathcal{L}$), gradients may overshoot the minimum and undo a lot of the work that was done even if we are using adaptive learning methods such as RMSProp. The reason is because gradient is a linear approximation of the loss function and may not capture information further than the point it was evaluated on such as the curvature of loss curve. Therefore, it's a common practice to clip the gradients to be in the interval . For this exercise, we'll clip the gradients to be in the interval . That means if the gradient is \u0026gt; 5 or \u0026lt; -5, it would be clipped to 5 and -5 respectively. Below are all the formulas needed to compute the gradients w.r.t. all parameters at all time steps.\n\\(\\nabla_{o^t}\\mathcal{L} = \\widehat{y^t} - y^t\\tag{6}\\) \\(\\nabla_{W_{hy}}\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_t \\nabla_{o^t}\\mathcal{L} . {h^t}^T\\tag{7}\\) \\(\\nabla_{c}\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_t \\nabla_{o^t}\\mathcal{L} \\tag{8}\\) \\(\\nabla_{h^t}\\mathcal{L} = W_{hy}^T . \\nabla_{o^t}\\mathcal{L} + \\underbrace { W_{hh}^T . \\nabla_{h^{t + 1}}\\mathcal{L} * (1 - tanh(W_{hh}h^{t} + W_{xh}x^{t + 1} + b) ^ 2)}_{dh_{next}} \\tag{9}\\) \\(\\nabla_{h^{t - 1}}\\mathcal{L} = W_{hh}^T . \\nabla_{h^t}\\mathcal{L} * (1 - tanh(h^t) ^ 2)\\tag{10}\\) \\(\\nabla_{x^t}\\mathcal{L} = W_{xh}^T . \\nabla_{h^t}\\mathcal{L} * (1 - tanh(W_{hh}h^{t-1} + W_{xh}x^t + b) ^ 2)\\tag{11}\\) \\(\\nabla_{W_{hh}}\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_t \\nabla_{h^t}\\mathcal{L} * (1 - tanh(W_{hh}h^{t-1} + W_{xh}x^t + b) ^ 2) . {h^{t - 1}}^T\\tag{12}\\) \\(\\nabla_{W_{xh}}\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_t \\nabla_{h^t}\\mathcal{L} * (1 - tanh(W_{hh}h^{t-1} + W_{xh}x^t + b) ^ 2) . {x^t}^T\\tag{13}\\) \\(\\nabla_{b}\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_t \\nabla_{h^t}\\mathcal{L} * (1 - tanh(h^t) ^ 2) \\tag{14}\\)\nNote that at last time step $T$, we'll initialize $dh_{next}$ to zeros since we can't get values from future. To stabilize the update at each time step since SGD may have so many oscillations, we'll be using one of the adaptive learning method optimizers. More specifically, we'll use Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSProp) which tends to have acceptable performance.\ndef clip_gradients(gradients, max_value): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Implements gradient clipping element-wise on gradients to be between the interval [-max_value, max_value]. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; for grad in gradients.keys(): np.clip(gradients[grad], -max_value, max_value, out=gradients[grad]) return gradients def rnn_backward(y, parameters, cache): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Implements Backpropagation on one name. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Retrieve xs, hs, and probs xs, hs, probs = cache # Initialize all gradients to zero dh_next = np.zeros_like(hs[0]) parameters_names = [\u0026quot;Whh\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Wxh\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Why\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;] grads = {} for param_name in parameters_names: grads[\u0026quot;d\u0026quot; + param_name] = np.zeros_like(parameters[param_name]) # Iterate over all time steps in reverse order starting from Tx for t in reversed(range(len(xs))): dy = np.copy(probs[t]) dy[y[t]] -= 1 grads[\u0026quot;dWhy\u0026quot;] += np.dot(dy, hs[t].T) grads[\u0026quot;dc\u0026quot;] += dy dh = np.dot(parameters[\u0026quot;Why\u0026quot;].T, dy) + dh_next dhraw = (1 - hs[t] ** 2) * dh grads[\u0026quot;dWhh\u0026quot;] += np.dot(dhraw, hs[t - 1].T) grads[\u0026quot;dWxh\u0026quot;] += np.dot(dhraw, xs[t].T) grads[\u0026quot;db\u0026quot;] += dhraw dh_next = np.dot(parameters[\u0026quot;Whh\u0026quot;].T, dhraw) # Clip the gradients using [-5, 5] as the interval grads = clip_gradients(grads, 5) # Get the last hidden state h_prev = hs[len(xs) - 1] return grads, h_prev   Sampling\nSampling is what makes the text generated by the RNN at each time step an interesting/creative text. On each time step (t), the RNN output the conditional probability distribution of the next character given all the previous characters, i.e. $P(c_t/c_1, c_2, ..., c_{t-1})$. Let's assume that we are at time step $t = 3$ and we're trying to predict the third character, the conditional probability distribution is: $P(c_3/c_1, c_2) = (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1)$. We'll have two extremes:\n Maximum entropy: the character will be picked randomly using uniform probability distribution; which means that all characters in the vocabulary dictionary are equally likely. Therefore, we'll end up with maximum randomness in picking the next character and the generated text will not be either meaningful or sound real. Minimum entropy: the character with the highest conditional probability will be picked on each time step. That means next character will be what the model estimates to be the right one based on the training text and learned parameters. As a result, the names generated will be both meaningful and sound real. However, it will also be repetitive and not as interesting since all the parameters were optimized to learn joint probability distribution in predicting the next character.  As we increase randomness, text will lose local structure; however, as we decrease randomness, the generated text will sound more real and start to preserve its local structure. For this exercise, we will sample from the distribution that's generated by the model which can be seen as an intermediate level of randomness between maximum and minimum entropy (see figure 5). Using this sampling strategy on the above distribution, the index 0 has $20$% probability of being picked, while index 2 has $40$% probability to be picked.\n  Sampling: An example of predicting next character using character-level language model.   Therefore, sampling will be used at test time to generate names character by character.\ndef sample(parameters, idx_to_chars, chars_to_idx, n): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Implements sampling of a squence of n characters characters length.

We'll use the default settings for RMSProp's hyperparameters and run the model for 100 iterations. On each iteration, we'll print out one sampled name and smoothed loss to see how the names generated start to get more interesting with more iterations as well as the loss will start decreasing.

We demonstrated in this post the main concepts behind statistical language models using the character-level language model. The task of this model is to generate names character by character using names obtained from census data that were consisted of 5,163 names. Below are the main key takeaways:\n If we have more data, a bigger model, and train longer, we may get more interesting results. However, to get very interesting results, we should instead use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with more than one layer deep. People have used 3 layers deep LSTM model with dropout and were able to generate very interesting results when applied on cookbooks and Shakespeare poems. LSTM models outperform simple RNN due to its ability in capturing longer time dependencies. With the sampling technique we're using, don't expect the RNN to generate meaningful sequence of characters (names). We used in this post each name as its own sequence; however, we may be able to speed up learning and get better results if we increase the batch size; let's say from one name to a sequence of 50 characters. We can control the level of randomness using the sampling strategy. Here, we balanced between what the model thinks it's the right character and the level of randomness.

In machine/deep learning terminology, it's the task of minimizing the cost/loss function J(w) parameterized by the model's parameters $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. Optimization algorithms (in case of minimization) have one of the following goals:\n Find the global minimum of the objective function. This is feasible if the objective function is convex, i.e. any local minimum is a global minimum. Find the lowest possible value of the objective function within its neighborhood. That's usually the case if the objective function is not convex as the case in most deep learning problems.  There are three kinds of optimization algorithms:\n Optimization algorithm that is not iterative and simply solves for one point. Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and converges to acceptable solution regardless of the parameters initialization such as gradient descent applied to logistic regression. Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and applied to a set of problems that have non-convex cost functions such as neural networks. Therefore, parameters' initialization plays a critical role in speeding up convergence and achieving lower error rates.  Gradient Descent is the most common optimization algorithm in machine learning and deep learning. It is a first-order optimization algorithm. This means it only takes into account the first derivative when performing the updates on the parameters. On each iteration, we update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function J(w) w.r.t the parameters where the gradient gives the direction of the steepest ascent. The size of the step we take on each iteration to reach the local minimum is determined by the learning rate α. Therefore, we follow the direction of the slope downhill until we reach a local minimum.\nIn this post, we'll cover gradient descent algorithm and its variants: Batch Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.\nLet's first see how gradient descent and its associated steps works on logistic regression before going into the details of its variants. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the logistic regression model has only two parameters: weight w and bias b.\n Initialize weight w and bias b to any random numbers. Pick a value for the learning rate α. The learning rate determines how big the step would be on each iteration.\n If α is very small, it would take long time to converge and become computationally expensive. IF α is large, it may fail to converge and overshoot the minimum.  Therefore, plot the cost function against different values of α and pick the value of α that is right before the first value that didn't converge so that we would have a very fast learning algorithm that converges (see figure 1).   Gradient descent with different learning rates.  Source     The most commonly used rates are : 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3.  Make sure to scale the data if it's on very different scales. If we don't scale the data, the level curves (contours) would be narrower and taller which means it would take longer time to converge (see figure 2).   Gradient descent: normalized versus unnormalized level curves.   Scale the data to have μ = 0 and σ = 1. Below is the formula for scaling each example: \\(\\frac {x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\)\n On each iteration, take the partial derivative of the cost function J(w) w.r.t each parameter (gradient):\n  \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}J(w, b) = \\nabla_wJ\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b}J(w, b) = \\nabla_bJ\\]\nThe update equations are:\n\\[w = w - \\alpha \\nabla_w J\\]\n\\[b = b - \\alpha \\nabla_b J\\]\n For the sake of illustration, let’s assume we don’t have bias. If the slope of the current value of w \u0026gt; 0, this means that we are to the right of optimal w*. Therefore, the update will be negative, and will start getting close to the optimal values of w*. However, if it’s negative, the update will be positive and will increase the current values of w to converge to the optimal values of w*(see figure 3):   Gradient descent. An illustration of how gradient descent algorithm uses the first derivative of the loss function to follow downhill it\u0026rsquo;s minimum.    Continue the process until the cost function converges. That is, until the error curve becomes flat and doesn't change. In addition, on each iteration, the step would be in the direction that gives the maximum change since it's perpendicular to level curves at each step.   Now let's discuss the three variants of gradient descent algorithm. The main difference between them is the amount of data we use when computing the gradients for each learning step. The trade-off between them is the accuracy of the gradient versus the time complexity to perform each parameter's update (learning step).\nBatch Gradient Descent  Batch Gradient Descent is when we sum up over all examples on each iteration when performing the updates to the parameters. Therefore, for each update, we have to sum over all examples: \\(w = w - \\alpha \\nabla_w J\\)\nfor i in range(num_epochs): grad = compute_gradient(data, params) params = params - learning_rate * grad  The main advantages:\n We can use fixed learning rate during training without worrying about learning rate decay. It has straight trajectory towards the minimum and it is guaranteed to converge in theory to the global minimum if the loss function is convex and to a local minimum if the loss function is not convex. It has unbiased estimate of gradients. The more the examples, the lower the standard error.  The main disadvantages:\n Even though we can use vectorized implementation, it may still be slow to go over all examples especially when we have large datasets. Each step of learning happens after going over all examples where some examples may be redundant and don't contribute much to the update.  Mini-Batch Gradient Descent  Instead of going over all examples, Mini-batch Gradient Descent sums up over lower number of examples based on batch size. Therefore, learning happens on each mini-batch of b examples: \\(w = w - \\alpha \\nabla_w J(x^{\\{i:i + b\\}}, y^{\\{i: i + b\\}}; w, b)\\)\n Shuffle the training dataset to avoid pre-existing order of examples. Partition the training dataset into b mini-batches based on the batch size. If the training set size is not divisible by batch size, the remaining will be its own batch.  for i in range(num_epochs): np.random.shuffle(data) for batch in radom_minibatches(data, batch_size=32): grad = compute_gradient(batch, params) params = params - learning_rate * grad  The batch size is something we can tune. It is usually chosen as power of 2 such as 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, etc. The reason behind it is because some hardware such as GPUs achieve better runtime with common batch sizes such as power of 2.\nThe main advantages:\n Faster than Batch version because it goes through a lot less examples than Batch (all examples). Randomly selecting examples will help avoid redundant examples or examples that are very similar that don't contribute much to the learning. With batch size \u0026lt; size of training set, it adds noise to the learning process that helps improving generalization error. Even though with more examples the estimate would have lower standard error, the return is less than linear compared to the computational burden we incur.  The main disadvantages:\n It won't converge. On each iteration, the learning step may go back and forth due to the noise. Therefore, it wanders around the minimum region but never converges. Due to the noise, the learning steps have more oscillations (see figure 4) and requires adding learning-decay to decrease the learning rate as we become closer to the minimum.   Gradient descent: batch versus mini-batch loss function.   With large training datasets, we don't usually need more than 2-10 passes over all training examples (epochs). Note: with batch size b = m, we get the Batch Gradient Descent.  Stochastic Gradient Descent  Instead of going through all examples, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) performs the parameters update on each example $(x^i, y^i)$. Therefore, learning happens on every example: \\(w = w - \\alpha \\nabla_w J(x^i, y^i; w, b)\\)\n Shuffle the training dataset to avoid pre-existing order of examples. Partition the training dataset into m examples.  for i in range(num_epochs): np.random.shuffle(data) for example in data: grad = compute_gradient(example, params) params = params - learning_rate * grad  It shares most of the advantages and the disadvantages with mini-batch version. Below are the ones that are specific to SGD:\n It adds even more noise to the learning process than mini-batch that helps improving generalization error. However, this would increase the run time. We can't utilize vectorization over 1 example and becomes very slow. Also, the variance becomes large since we only use 1 example for each learning step.  Below is a graph that shows the gradient descent's variants and their direction towards the minimum:   Gradient descent variants\u0026rsquo; trajectory towards minimum   As the figure above shows, SGD direction is very noisy compared to mini-batch.\nChallenges  Below are some challenges regarding gradient descent algorithm in general as well as its variants - mainly batch and mini-batch:\n Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm, which means it doesn't take into account the second derivatives of the cost function. However, the curvature of the function affects the size of each learning step. The gradient measures the steepness of the curve but the second derivative measures the curvature of the curve. Therefore, if:\n Second derivative = 0 --\u0026gt; the curvature is linear. Therefore, the step size = the learning rate α. Second derivative \u0026gt; 0 --\u0026gt; the curvature is going upward. Therefore, the step size \u0026lt; the learning rate α and may lead to divergence. Second derivative \u0026lt; 0 --\u0026gt; the curvature is going downward. Therefore, the step size \u0026gt; the learning rate α.  As a result, the direction that looks promising to the gradient may not be so and may lead to slow the learning process or even diverge.\n If Hessian matrix has poor conditioning number, i.e. the direction of the most curvature has much more curvature than the direction of the lowest curvature. This will lead the cost function to be very sensitive in some directions and insensitive in other directions. As a result, it will make it harder on the gradient because the direction that looks promising for the gradient may not lead to big changes in the cost function (see figure 6).   Gradient descent fails to exploit the curvature information contained in the Hessian matrix.    The norm of the gradient $g^Tg$ is supposed to decrease slowly with each learning step because the curve is getting flatter and steepness of the curve will decrease. However, we see that the norm of the gradient is increasing, because of the curvature of the curve. Nonetheless, even though the gradients' norm is increasing, we're able to achieve a very low error rates (see figure 7).   Gradient norm.  Source     In small dimensions, local minimum is common; however, in large dimensions, saddle points are more common. Saddle point is when the function curves up in some directions and curves down in other directions. In other words, saddle point looks a minimum from one direction and a maximum from other direction (see figure 8). This happens when at least one eigenvalue of the hessian matrix is negative and the rest of eigenvalues are positive.   Saddle point.    As discussed previously, choosing a proper learning rate is hard. Also, for mini-batch gradient descent, we have to adjust the learning rate during the training process to make sure it converges to the local minimum and not wander around it. Figuring out the decay rate of the learning rate is also hard and changes with different datasets.\n All parameter updates have the same learning rate; however, we may want to perform larger updates to some parameters that have their directional derivatives more inline with the trajectory towards the minimum than other parameters.\n  ","date":1513814400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513814400,"objectID":"8089c851326ab5d9a9cdd9f2fe34e17a","permalink":"https://imaddabbura.github.io/post/gradient-descent-algorithm/","publishdate":"2017-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gradient-descent-algorithm/","section":"post","summary":"Optimization refers to the task of minimizing/maximizing an objective function f(x) parameterized by x.

It is very costly for organizations, where costs include but not limited to: separation, vacancy, recruitment, training and replacement. On average, organizations invest between four weeks and three months training new employees. This investment would be a loss for the company if the new employee decided to leave the first year. Furthermore, organizations such as consulting firms would suffer from deterioration in customer satisfaction due to regular changes in Account Reps and/or Consultants that would lead to loss of businesses with clients.\nIn this post, we’ll work on simulated HR data from kaggle to build a classifier that helps us predict what kind of employees will be more likely to leave given some attributes. Such classifier would help an organization predict employee turnover and be pro-active in helping to solve such costly matter. We’ll restrict ourselves to use the most common classifiers: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine.\nThe data has 14,999 examples (samples).

Since there are no missing values, we do not have to do any imputation. However, there are some data preprocessing needed:\n Change sales feature name to department. Convert salary into ordinal categorical feature since there is intrinsic order between: low, medium and high. Create dummy features from department feature and drop the first one to avoid linear dependency where some learning algorithms may struggle.  # Rename sales feature into department df = df.rename(columns={\u0026quot;sales\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;department\u0026quot;}) # Map salary into integers salary_map = {\u0026quot;low\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;medium\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;high\u0026quot;: 2} df[\u0026quot;salary\u0026quot;] = df[\u0026quot;salary\u0026quot;].map(salary_map) # Create dummy variables for department feature df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=[\u0026quot;department\u0026quot;], drop_first=True)  The data is now ready to be used for modeling. The final number of features are now 17.\nModeling  Let’s first take a look at the proportion of each class to see if we’re dealing with balanced or imbalanced data, since each one has its own set of tools to be used when fitting classifiers.\n# Get number of positve and negative examples pos = df[df[\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;] == 1].shape[0] neg = df[df[\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;] == 0].shape[0] print(\u0026quot;Positive examples = {}\u0026quot;.format(pos)) print(\u0026quot;Negative examples = {}\u0026quot;.format(neg)) print(\u0026quot;Proportion of positive to negative examples = {:.2f}%\u0026quot;.format((pos / neg) * 100)) sns.countplot(df[\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;]) plt.xticks((0, 1), [\u0026quot;Didn't leave\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Left\u0026quot;]) plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;Left\u0026quot;) plt.ylabel(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;Class counts\u0026quot;);    Class counts.   As the graph shows, we have an imbalanced dataset. As a result, when we fit classifiers on such datasets, we should use metrics other than accuracy when comparing models such as f1-score or AUC (area under ROC curve). Moreover, class imbalance influences a learning algorithm during training by making the decision rule biased towards the majority class by implicitly learns a model that optimizes the predictions based on the majority class in the dataset. There are three ways to deal with this issue:\n Assign a larger penalty to wrong predictions from the minority class. Upsampling the minority class or downsampling the majority class. Generate synthetic training examples.  Nonetheless, there is no definitive guide or best practices to deal with such situations. Therefore, we have to try them all and see which one works best for the problem on hand. We’ll restrict ourselves to use the first two, i.e, assign larger penalty to wrong predictions from the minority class using class_weight in classifiers that allows us do that and evaluate upsampling/downsampling on the training data to see which gives higher performance. First, split the data into training and test sets using 80/20 split; 80% of the data will be used to train the models and 20% to test the performance of the models. Second, Upsample the minority class and downsample the majority class. For this data set, positive class is the minority class and negative class is the majority class.\n# Convert dataframe into numpy objects and split them into # train and test sets: 80/20 X = df.loc[:, df.columns != \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;].values y = df.loc[:, df.columns == \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;].values.flatten() X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=1) # Upsample minority class X_train_u, y_train_u = resample(X_train[y_train == 1], y_train[y_train == 1], replace=True, n_samples=X_train[y_train == 0].shape[0], random_state=1) X_train_u = np.concatenate((X_train[y_train == 0], X_train_u)) y_train_u = np.concatenate((y_train[y_train == 0], y_train_u)) # Downsample majority class X_train_d, y_train_d = resample(X_train[y_train == 0], y_train[y_train == 0], replace=True, n_samples=X_train[y_train == 1].shape[0], random_state=1) X_train_d = np.concatenate((X_train[y_train == 1], X_train_d)) y_train_d = np.concatenate((y_train[y_train == 1], y_train_d)) print(\u0026quot;Original shape:\u0026quot;, X_train.shape, y_train.shape) print(\u0026quot;Upsampled shape:\u0026quot;, X_train_u.shape, y_train_u.shape) print(\u0026quot;Downsampled shape:\u0026quot;, X_train_d.shape, y_train_d.shape)   Original shape: (11999, 17) (11999,) Upsampled shape: (18284, 17) (18284,) Downsampled shape: (5714, 17) (5714,)  I don’t think we need to apply dimensionality reduction such as PCA because: 1) We want to know the importance of each feature in determining who will leave versus who will not (inference). 2) Dimension of the data set is decent (17 features). However, it’s good to see how many principal components needed to explain 90%, 95% and 99% of the variation in the data.\n# Build PCA using standarized trained data pca = PCA(n_components=None, svd_solver=\u0026quot;full\u0026quot;) pca.fit(StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_train)) cum_var_exp = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_) plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6)) plt.bar(range(1, 18), pca.explained_variance_ratio_, align=\u0026quot;center\u0026quot;, color='red', label=\u0026quot;Individual explained variance\u0026quot;) plt.step(range(1, 18), cum_var_exp, where=\u0026quot;mid\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;Cumulative explained variance\u0026quot;) plt.xticks(range(1, 18)) plt.legend(loc=\u0026quot;best\u0026quot;) plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;Principal component index\u0026quot;, {\u0026quot;fontsize\u0026quot;: 14}) plt.ylabel(\u0026quot;Explained variance ratio\u0026quot;, {\u0026quot;fontsize\u0026quot;: 14}) plt.title(\u0026quot;PCA on training data\u0026quot;, {\u0026quot;fontsize\u0026quot;: 16});    PCA.   Looks like it needs 14, 15 and 16 principal components to capture 90%, 95% and 99% of the variation in the data respectively. In other words, this means that the data is already in a good space since eigenvalues are very close to each other and gives further evidence that we don’t need to compress the data. The methodology that we’ll follow when building the classifiers goes as follows:\n Build a pipeline that handles all the steps when fitting the classifier using scikit-learn’s make_pipeline which will have two steps: I. Standardizing the data to speed up convergence and make all features on the same scale. II. The classifier (estimator) we want to use to fit the model. Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters using 10-folds cross validation. We can use RandomizedSearchCV which is faster and may outperform GridSearchCV especially if we have more than two hyperparameters and the range for each one is very big; however, GridSearchCV will work just fine since we have only two hyperparameters and descent range. Fit the model using training data. Plot both confusion matrix and ROC curve for the best estimator using test data.  Repeat the above steps for Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. Next, pick the classifier that has the highest cross validation f1 score. Note: some of the hyperparameter ranges will be guided by the paper Data-driven Advice for Applying Machine Learning to Bioinformatics Problems.\nRandom Forest  First, we will start by fitting a Random Forest classifier using unsampled, upsampled and downsampled data. Second, we will evaluate each method using cross validation (CV) f1-score and pick the one with the highest CV f1-score. Finally, we will use that method to fit the rest of the classifiers. The only hyperparameters we’ll tune are:\n max_feature: how many features to consider randomly on each split. This will help avoid having few strong features to be picked on each split and let other features have the chance to contribute. Therefore, predictions will be less correlated and the variance of each tree will decrease. min_samples_leaf: how many examples to have for each split to be a final leaf node. Random Forest is an ensemble model that has multiple trees (n_estimators). The final prediction would be a weighting average (regression) or mode (classification) of the predictions from all estimators. Note: a high number of trees doesn't cause overfitting.  # Build random forest classifier methods_data = {\u0026quot;Original\u0026quot;: (X_train, y_train), \u0026quot;Upsampled\u0026quot;: (X_train_u, y_train_u), \u0026quot;Downsampled\u0026quot;: (X_train_d, y_train_d)} for method in methods_data.keys(): pip_rf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, class_weight=\u0026quot;balanced\u0026quot;, random_state=123)) hyperparam_grid = { \u0026quot;randomforestclassifier__n_estimators\u0026quot;: [10, 50, 100, 500], \u0026quot;randomforestclassifier__max_features\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;log2\u0026quot;, 0.4, 0.5], \u0026quot;randomforestclassifier__min_samples_leaf\u0026quot;: [1, 3, 5], \u0026quot;randomforestclassifier__criterion\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;gini\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;entropy\u0026quot;]} gs_rf = GridSearchCV(pip_rf, hyperparam_grid, scoring=\u0026quot;f1\u0026quot;, cv=10, n_jobs=-1) gs_rf.fit(methods_data[method][0], methods_data[method][1]) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[0m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;The best hyperparameters for {} data:\u0026quot;.format(method)) for hyperparam in gs_rf.best_params_.keys(): print(hyperparam[hyperparam.find(\u0026quot;__\u0026quot;) + 2:], \u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, gs_rf.best_params_[hyperparam]) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[94m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;Best 10-folds CV f1-score: {:.2f}%.\u0026quot;.format((gs_rf.best_score_) * 100))    Random Forest hyperparameter tuning results.   Upsampling yielded the highest CV f1-score with 99.8%. Therefore, we’ll be using the upsampled data to fit the rest of the classifiers. The new data now has 18,284 examples: 50% belonging to the positive class, and 50% belonging to the negative class.\nLet’s refit the Random Forest with Upsampled data using best hyperparameters tuned above and plot confusion matrix and ROC curve using test data.\n  Random Forest.   Gradient Boosting Trees  Gradient Boosting trees are the same as Random Forest except for:\n It starts with small tree and start learning from grown trees by taking into account the residual of grown trees. More trees can lead to overfitting; opposite to Random Forest.  Therefore, we can think of each tree as a weak learner. The two other hyperparameters than max_features and n_estimators that we're going to tune are:\n learning_rate: rate the tree learns, the slower the better. max_depth: number of split each time a tree is growing which limits the number of nodes in each tree.  Let’s fit GB classifier and plot confusion matrix and ROC curve using test data.\n# Build Gradient Boosting classifier pip_gb = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), GradientBoostingClassifier(loss=\u0026quot;deviance\u0026quot;, random_state=123)) hyperparam_grid = {\u0026quot;gradientboostingclassifier__max_features\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;log2\u0026quot;, 0.5], \u0026quot;gradientboostingclassifier__n_estimators\u0026quot;: [100, 300, 500], \u0026quot;gradientboostingclassifier__learning_rate\u0026quot;: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1], \u0026quot;gradientboostingclassifier__max_depth\u0026quot;: [1, 2, 3]} gs_gb = GridSearchCV(pip_gb, param_grid=hyperparam_grid, scoring=\u0026quot;f1\u0026quot;, cv=10, n_jobs=-1) gs_gb.fit(X_train, y_train) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[0m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;The best hyperparameters:\u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;-\u0026quot; * 25) for hyperparam in gs_gb.best_params_.keys(): print(hyperparam[hyperparam.find(\u0026quot;__\u0026quot;) + 2:], \u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, gs_gb.best_params_[hyperparam]) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[94m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;Best 10-folds CV f1-score: {:.2f}%.\u0026quot;.format((gs_gb.best_score_) * 100))    Gradient Boosting Trees hyperparameter tuning results.     Gradient Boosting Trees.   K-Nearest Neighbors  KNN is called a lazy learning algorithm because it doesn’t learn or fit any parameter. It takes n_neighbors points from the training data closest to the point we're interested to predict it's class and take the mode (majority vote) of the classes for the neighboring point as its class. The two hyperparameters we're going to tune are:\n n_neighbors: number of neighbors to use in prediction. weights: how much weight to assign neighbors based on: “uniform”: all neighboring points have the same weight. “distance”: use the inverse of euclidean distance of each neighboring point used in prediction.  Let’s fit KNN classifier and plot confusion matrix and ROC curve.\n# Build KNN classifier pip_knn = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsClassifier()) hyperparam_range = range(1, 20) gs_knn = GridSearchCV(pip_knn, param_grid={\u0026quot;kneighborsclassifier__n_neighbors\u0026quot;: hyperparam_range, \u0026quot;kneighborsclassifier__weights\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;uniform\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;distance\u0026quot;]}, scoring=\u0026quot;f1\u0026quot;, cv=10, n_jobs=-1) gs_knn.fit(X_train, y_train) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[0m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;The best hyperparameters:\u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;-\u0026quot; * 25) for hyperparam in gs_knn.best_params_.keys(): print(hyperparam[hyperparam.find(\u0026quot;__\u0026quot;) + 2:], \u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, gs_knn.best_params_[hyperparam]) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[94m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;Best 10-folds CV f1-score: {:.2f}%.\u0026quot;.format((gs_knn.best_score_) * 100))    K-Nearest Neighbors hyperparameter tuning results.     K-Nearest Neighbors.   Logistic Regression  For logistic regression, we’ll tune three hyperparameters:\n penalty: type of regularization, L2 or L1 regularization. C: the opposite of regularization of parameter λλ. The higher C the less regularization. We'll use values that cover the full range between unregularized to fully regularized where model is the mode of the examples' label. fit_intercept: whether to include intercept or not.  We won’t use any non-linearities such as polynomial features.\n# Build logistic model classifier pip_logmod = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression(class_weight=\u0026quot;balanced\u0026quot;)) hyperparam_range = np.arange(0.5, 20.1, 0.5) hyperparam_grid = {\u0026quot;logisticregression__penalty\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;l1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;l2\u0026quot;], \u0026quot;logisticregression__C\u0026quot;: hyperparam_range, \u0026quot;logisticregression__fit_intercept\u0026quot;: [True, False] } gs_logmodel = GridSearchCV(pip_logmod, hyperparam_grid, scoring=\u0026quot;accuracy\u0026quot;, cv=2, n_jobs=-1) gs_logmodel.fit(X_train, y_train) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[0m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;The best hyperparameters:\u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;-\u0026quot; * 25) for hyperparam in gs_logmodel.best_params_.keys(): print(hyperparam[hyperparam.find(\u0026quot;__\u0026quot;) + 2:], \u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, gs_logmodel.best_params_[hyperparam]) print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[94m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;Best 10-folds CV f1-score: {:.2f}%.\u0026quot;.format((gs_logmodel.best_score_) * 100))    Logistic Regression hyperparameter tuning results.     Logistic Regression.   Support Vector Machine  SVM is comutationally very expensive to tune it’s hyperparameters for two reasons:\n With big datasets, it becomes very slow. It has good number of hyperparameters to tune that takes very long time to tune on a CPU.  Therefore, we’ll use recommended hyperparameters’ values from the paper we mentioned before that showed to yield the best performane on Penn Machine Learning Benchmark 165 datasets. The hyperparameters that we usually look to tune are:\n C, gamma, kernel, degree and coef0  # Build SVM classifier clf_svc = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(C=0.01, gamma=0.1, kernel=\u0026quot;poly\u0026quot;, degree=5, coef0=10, probability=True)) clf_svc.fit(X_train, y_train) svc_cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf_svc, X=X_train, y=y_train, scoring=\u0026quot;f1\u0026quot;, cv=10, n_jobs=-1) # Print CV print(\u0026quot;\\033[1m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;\\033[94m\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;The 10-folds CV f1-score is: {:.2f}%\u0026quot;.format( np.mean(svc_cv_scores) * 100)) The 10-folds CV f1-score is: 96.38%  The 10-folds CV f1-score is: 96.38%\n  Support Vector Machine.   Conclusion  Let’s conclude by printing out the test accuracy rates for all classifiers we’ve trained so far and plot ROC curves. Then we will pick the classifier that has the highest area under ROC curve.\n  Comparing ROC curves for all classifiers.   Even though Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees have almost equal AUC, Random Forest has higher accuracy rate and an f1-score with 99.27% and 99.44% respectively. Therefore, we safely say Random Forest outperforms the rest of the classifiers. Let’s have a look of feature importances from Random Forest classifier.\n  Random Forest feature importance.   Looks like the five most important features are:\n satisfaction_level time_spend_company average_montly_hours number_project lats_evaluation  The take home message is the following:\n When dealing with imbalanced classes, accuracy is not a good method for model evaluation. AUC and f1-score are examples of metrics we can use. Upsampling/downsampling, data synthetic and using balanced class weights are good strategies to try to improve the accuracy of a classifier for imbalanced classes datasets. GridSearchCV helps tune hyperparameters for each learning algorithm. RandomizedSearchCV is faster and may outperform GridSearchCV especially when we have more than two hyperparameters to tune. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) isn’t always recommended especially if the data is in a good feature space and their eigen values are very close to each other. As expected, ensemble models outperforms other learning algorithms in most cases.

It is very costly for organizations, where costs include but not limited to: separation, vacancy, recruitment, training and replacement. On average, organizations invest between four weeks and three months training new employees. This investment would be a loss for the company if the new employee decided to leave the first year. Furthermore, organizations such as consulting firms would suffer from deterioration in customer satisfaction due to regular changes in Account Reps and/or Consultants that would lead to loss of businesses with clients.","tags":["Classification","Machine Learning"],"title":"Predicting Employee Turnover","type":"post"}]
